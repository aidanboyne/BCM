Welcome! This is primarily a website where I keep my notes to stay organized. I also try to keep it updated with links to potentially helpful resources. 
If you have any suggestions or want to add something, shoot me an email at [aidanboyne@gmail.com](mailto:aidanboyne@gmail.com) or leave a comment on the comments page if it is working.

> Posts are organized by _type_ (PBL cases, Lecture Notes, etc.) under the **categories** tab in the sidebar to the left. Posts are organized by _term_ (TTM, FOM, Cardio, etc.) under the **tags** tab in the sidebar to the left.
