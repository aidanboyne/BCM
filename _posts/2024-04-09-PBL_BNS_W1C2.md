## The Brain

Most material below adapted from [this article](https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Anatomy-of-the-Brain) from the AANS.

### Meninges
- Dura Mater: outer periostem and inner dura which protect and secure the brain. The falx separates the right and left hemispheres and the tenotrium separates the cerebellum and lower brain from the cortex.
- Arachnoid: Elastic tissue and blood vessels covering the brain
- Pia Mater: A single cell layer immediatley overlying the brain surface with many blood vessels. CSF flows between the pia and arachnoid.

### Ventricular System
Comprised of four ventricles, 2 lateral ventricles which communicate with the third ventricle located at the center of the brain and contained by the thalamus and hypothalamus via the _Foramen of Munro_. The thrid ventricle communicates with the fourth via the _Aqueduct of Sylvius_. CSF is produced in the choroid plexus within the ventricles and flows around the brain and into the spinal cord via passing through an opening in the fourth ventricle.

### Brainstem
- **Midbrain**: involved in ocular motion
- **Pons**: cordination of eye and facial movements, facial sensation, hearing and balance.
- **Medulla**: controls breathing, blood pressure, heart rhythms and swallowing. Messages from the cortex to the spinal cord and nerves that branch from the spinal cord are sent through the pons and the brainstem. 

The brainstem also contains part of the reticular activating system along with the thalamus. 10 of the 12 cranial nerves originate from the brainstem.

### Cerebellum
Separated from the cerebrum by the tentorium, the cerebellum fine tunes motor activity or movement, maintains posture and balance by controlling muscle tone and the position of limbs. The cerebellum is important in one's ability to perform rapid and repetitive actions. Lesions in the cerebellum cause ipsilateral symptoms.

### Cerebrum

The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres connected via the corpus callosum. Sulci (grooves), fissues (large grooves), and gyri (bulges) cover the surface. The cerebrum is divided into four lobes:

- **Frontal Lobe**: voluntary movement, speech, and intellectual and behavior function. The precentral gyrus contains the primary motor cortex. The prefrontal cortex is important in memory, temper, concentration, and personality. The premotor cortex located immediatley anterior to the primary motor cortex guides eye and head movement. **Broca's area** is located in the left frontal lobe and is important for language _production_.
- **Temporal Lobe**: divided into ventral and lateral parts. The right temporal lobe is critical for visual memory and object/facial recognition. The left lobe contains **Werneke's area**, critical for language _comprehension_.
- **Parietal Lobe**: interpret vision, hearing, motor, sensory, and memory signals recived from other areas of the brain and gives meaning to objects
- **Occipital Lobe**: receive and process visual information such as color and shape. Responsible tor the contralateral visual field

Lesions in the cerebrum typically cause symptoms on the contralateral side, however this is not always the case

### Other structures
- **Limbic system**: hypothalamus, part of talamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Involved in emotion and memory formation
- **Pineal gland**: role in sexual maturation in humans
- **Pituitary gland**: controls hormone secretion in conjunction with the hypothalamus. Located in the sella turcica
- **Thalamus**: relay station for all senses other than smell. Plays a role in pain, attention, and alertness. Includes the hypothalamus, epythalamus, ventral thalamus, and dorsal thalamus. Surrounded by the basal ganglia
- **Posterior Fossa**: Cavity in the rostral skull containing the cerebellum, brainstem, and CNV - CNXII

![Brain Anatomy](/img/brain_outer_anatomy.png)

### Cranial Nerves

1. Olfactory: Smell
2. Optic: Visual fields and ability to see
3. Oculomotor: Eye movements; eyelid opening
4. Trochlear: Eye movements
5. Trigeminal: Facial sensation
6. Abducens: Eye movements
7. Facial: Eyelid closing; facial expression; taste sensation
8. Auditory/vestibular: Hearing; sense of balance
9. Glossopharyngeal: Taste sensation; swallowing
10. Vagus: Swallowing; taste sensation
11. Accessory: Control of neck and shoulder muscles
12. Hypoglossal: Tongue movement

### Case Term Definitions

1. _Pronator drift_: Subtle downward rotation or drift of the forearm when the patient holds their arms outstretched with palms facing upward and eyes closed. It indicates weakness or impairment of the corticospinal tract, typically due to UMN lesions, such as in strokes or multiple sclerosis.
2. _Satelliting_: Abnormal movements of fingers or limbs around a central focus, often seen in Parkinson's disease. It suggests dysregulation of motor control circuits, particularly involving basal ganglia dysfunction.
3. _Dysarthria_: Speech disorder characterized by difficulty articulating words due to impaired control over the muscles involved in speech production. It can result from various neurological conditions affecting the brainstem, cranial nerves, or motor cortex, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis.
4. _Hoffman’s sign_: Elicited by flicking or briskly snapping the middle or ring finger downwards and observing for an involuntary flexion of the thumb and/or index finger. A positive Hoffman’s sign suggests hyperexcitability of the corticospinal tract, often seen in conditions like spinal cord compression, multiple sclerosis, or cervical myelopathy.
5. _Vasogenic edema_: Cerebral edema due to increased permeability of blood vessels, leading to the leakage of fluid and proteins into the brain parenchyma. It is often associated with conditions such as brain tumors, infections, or strokes, and can cause significant neurological symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure and tissue compression.


## Brain Tumors

Primary brain tumors are categorized as glial or non-glial (nerves, blood vessels, glands) and benign or malignant. Metastatic tumors are more common. Lung metasteses are the most common - up to 40% of patients with lung cancer will develop metastatic brain tumors. Other common metastatic cancers include breast, colon, kidney and melanoma. Differentials for brain lesions must also include abscess, demyelenation, and parasitic infection.

### Benign Tumors
- **Chordomas**: slow-growing tumors at the base of the skull and lower spine. Rare. May cause compressive symptoms
- **Craniopharyngiomas**: typically arising from the pituitary and thus require hormone replacement therapy in most cases
- **Gagliocytomas**: rare neoplasms of nerve cells, primarily occuring in young adults
- **Glomus jugulare**: glomus tumors at the top of the jugular vein. Very rare
- **Meningiomas**: Most common benign intracranial tumors that very rareley can be malignant. Originate from the meninges
- **Pineocytomas**: slow-growing and non-invasive lesions
- **Pituitary adenomas**: most common following glioma, meningioma, and schwannoma. Often benign and malignant tumors rarley spread. May secrete hormones causing various effects
- **Schwannomas**: Most often affecting the vestibulocochlear nerve, causing progressive hearing loss and tinnitus followed by vestibular symptoms. Compression of other nerves such as the facial nerve (VII), trigeminal nerve (V), glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves (IX, X) can result in facial twitching and weakness, trigemial parasethesia and tounge tingling, and palatal paresis, hoarse voice, and dysphagia respectivley. Especially large tumors can reuslt in cerebellar and brainstem compression along with elevated ICP.

### Malignant Tumors
-  **Astrocytomas**: most common glioma, accounting for about half of all primary brain and spinal cord tumors. Most prevalent in middle age men, though young adults and children often get low-grade tumors at the base of the brain
- **Ependyomas**
- **Glioblastoma Multiforme**: most invasive glial tumor more prevalent in men. Comprised of multiple cell types (usually astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and associated with a poor prognosis
- **Medulloblastomas**: typically cerebellar and high-grade. Arise most often in children but responsive to radiation and chemo
- **Oligodendrogliomas**

### Other Tumors
- Hemangioblastomas: blood vessel tumors often accompanied by cysts
- Rhabdoid tumors: rare, agressive tumors spreading throughout the CNS appearing in mutliple sites throughout the body. More prevalent in children.

### Localizing a lesion

![Common Lesions](/img/common_brain_lesions.png)

#### Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Lesions

The upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex and travel down to the brain stem or spinal cord, while the lower motor neurons begin in the spinal cord and go on to innervate muscles and glands throughout the body. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554616/)
- **UMN Lesion**: hyperreflexia, spasticity, and a positive Babinski reflex (upward response of the big toe when the plantar surface of the foot is stroked with other toes fanning out)
- **LMN Lesion**: hyporeflexia, flaccid paralysis, and atrophy.


### Diagnosis

In this case, the patient was initially diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. This typically presents with the following, all of which are worsened by sleep, sustained hand/arm position, or repetitive hand/wrist action:
* Dull, aching discomfort in the hand, forearm, or upper arm
* Paresthesia in the hand
* Weakness or clumsiness of the hand
* Occurrence of any of these symptoms in the median distribution

#### Differential for Peripheral Neuropathy

![Diff Peripheral Neuro](/img/Peripheral_Neuropathy.jpg)
    [_Source_](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/1215/p732.html)
## Glioblastoma

Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor of _astrocytes_ which often arise de novo. Recently the WHO updated their classification system and now Glioblastoma, IDH mutant is classified as Astrocytoma, IDH mutant, grade 4.

Glioblastoma most often occurs in the frontal lobe, followed by the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe. Symptoms are caused by mass effect or edema and present rapidly. These include
* Seizure
* Severe headache
* Memory and language issues
* Changes in personality and behavior
* Muscle weakness or paralysis
* Fatigue
* Issues with coordination
* Speech, hearing, and vision problems

**Risk Factors** for gliomas as a whole only include ionizing radiation. Investigations into the relationship between atopic disorder and decreased glioma risk are ongoing. Certain gliomas are associated with famililar syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type I (pilocytic astrocytomas) neurofibromatosis type II (spinal epenymomas).

### Imaging

Standard of care for diagnostic and management imaging of glioblastoma is MRI. T1-weighted MRI enhances the signal of the fatty tissue and suppresses the signal of the water. T2-weighted MRI enhances the signal of the water. Gadolinium contrast may be used to enhance structure visibility on T1 images.

![MRI_glio](/img/Glioblastoma.png)
    _From left to right: T1 contrast, T2, FET-PET, Histology_

Contraindications to MRI include metallic forein bodies near the eye (common in machine shop workers), some medication pumps, bullets or shrapnel, and some vascular clips, neurostims, choclear implants, and pacemaker/ICDs. Many devices are now made MRI compatible.

CT is often used to pick up various cerebral pathologies and is indicated in the following cases:
- AMS with known hemorrhage, mass, infection, or infarct, coagulopathy/anticoag, suspected CNS infection or elevated ECP, HT emergency, and acute delerium. 
- Suspected intracranial hemorrhave, dural venous sinus thrombosis, TIA or ischemic stroke
- Dementia
- Head truama with GCS <13, penetrating head truama, ataxia, or when clinically appropriate
- Chronic trauma with unexplained deficits
- Thunderclap headache, headache with papilledema, exertional headache, suspected cancer
- Epilepsy with change in pattern or initial imaging for new seizures

CTA is gold standard for ischemic stroke, TIA, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage

#### EMG [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography)

Electromyography takes advantage of the motor unit action potential — when an anterior horn cell is activated, all the muscle fibers belonging to that motor unit are depolarized synchronously. The total electrical activity from all these individual muscle fibers produces a waveform recorded by the EMG needle electrode as the motor unit action potential (MUAP). The MUAP usually has a triphasic configuration resulting from the propagation of depolarization throughout the motor unit and its muscle fibers, as follows:
- A positive (downward) deflection as the electrical impulse moves along the muscle fiber membrane toward the recording electrode
- A negative (upward) deflection when the impulse moves under the electrode
- Another positive (downward) deflection as the impulse moves away from the electrode

EMG is used in the workup of motor neuronopathies (ALS, SMA), radiculopathies, plexopathies, neuropathies, NMJ disorders, and myopathies.

### Genetic alterations

![Genetic Genes](/img/glioma_genes.webp)

Glioblastomas in particular have 6 distinct molecular subgroups.
* 2 pediatric glioblastomas with H3F3A missense mutations
* IDH mutation causing g-CIMP and proneural mRNA (usually in young adults)
- PDGF-receptor alpha AKA RTK 1 class causing proneural mRNA (adolecents and young adults)
* Classic (RTK II) and mesenchymal classes (most common in patients >50y.o.)

#### IDH mutations
Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes, of which there are three isoforms, are essential enzymes that participate in several major metabolic processes, such as the Krebs cycle, glutamine metabolism, lipogenesis and redox regulation. IDH1 is located in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 and IDH3 are located in the mitochondrial matrix. The catalytic sites of IDH1 and IDH2 exhibit affinity for the substrate, isocitrate, together with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) and a divalent metal cation, usually magnesium or manganese, resulting in the formation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IDH3, which also catalyses the transformation from isocitrate into α-KG, employs nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as its cofactor. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-020-0814-x). IDH-mutated glioma shows a distinctive metabolic pattern compared with other solid tumours—most notably, the **_remarkably reduced glycolysis_**, the metabolic hallmark of fast proliferating malignancies. The unique metabolic pathways in IDH-mutated glioma not only explain the **slow-growing** nature of this disease but also suggest that developing targeted strategies for IDH-mutant-specific metabolic patterns could be a valuable approach for future glioma therapeutics.

IDH mutations are much more common in WHO grade II and III gliomas (60–80%) than in glioblastomas (5–10%). As mentioned earlier, WHO grade IV glioblastoma with IDH mutation is now classified as a Astrocytoma, IDH mutant, grade IV. IDH 1/2 mutated tumors are treated identically but are associated with improved prognosis. [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-and-prognosis-of-idh-wildtype-glioblastoma-in-adults)

IDH **wildtype** tumors (where IDH is normal) are much more common and often have a molecular profile of monosomy 10, tirsomy 7, and EGFR amplifications. Most also have TERT promoter mutations resulting in increased gene expression, and some have EGFRvIII deletions (20-25%).

### Treatment

#### Biopsy [[ref]](https://academic.oup.com/nop/article/9/5/364/6541330?login=false)

Brain mapping to avoid eloquent areas which include the bilateral frontal motor areas (cortical structures such as the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and the supplementary motor cortex, and subcortical structures such as the corticospinal tract, arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and internal capsule), the bilateral parietal somatosensory areas (postcentral gyrus), the bilateral primary visual cortex in the occipital lobes, and the speech areas of Broca and Wernicke in respectively the left frontal and temporal lobes via nTMS, MGI, DTI, and fMRI and intraoperativley can help avoid damage. Mapping of speech areas is only possible in awake patients. Intraoperative fluoresence, US, and ioMRI can maximize extent of resection while minimizing postoperative defects.

Removal of margin beyond the tumor (supramarginal or supratotal resection) has recently been investigated and has shown promising results in overall survival in young patients and in all patients with IDHwt tumors.

* Stereotactic CT-guided Biopsy: This procedure involves using computerized tomography (CT) to guide a needle to the tumor site to obtain a tissue sample. It is particularly useful for untreated or recurrent malignant astrocytomas. The biopsy can be obtained from different zones of the tumor, with varying diagnostic yields. This method is considered the best way to guide management in patients who do not require craniotomy for tumor mass effect.
* Small Excisional Biopsy under General Anesthesia: This procedure involves the surgical removal of a small piece of the tumor while the patient is under general anesthesia. It is part of the standard therapy for glioblastoma, which includes resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. The goal is to maximize the extent of resection while minimizing postoperative neurological complications.
* “Awake” Craniotomy Surgery: This procedure is performed while the patient is awake but sedated. It allows the surgeon to test regions of the brain before they are incised or removed, helping to protect essential neurological functions. Awake craniotomy for glioblastoma resection achieves an acceptable gross total resection rate of 74.7%, and neurological deficits persisting beyond 3 months occurred in only 1.9% of patients. [[ref]](https://academic.oup.com/noa/article/2/1/vdaa111/5908325?login=false)

#### Therapy

The standard of care for adult patients is **surgery** to the greatest extent possible followed by concomitant and adjuvant **temozolomide** (an alkylating agent prodrug, delivering a methyl group to purine bases of DNA (O6-guanine; N7-guanine and N3-adenine)) plus **radiotherapy** followed by temozolomide alone. Flourescence-guided visualization via 5-aminolevulinic acid can help guide macroscopic rescetion. Fraail patients can recieve the above or radiotherapy/temozolomide alone. All molecular classifications of glioblastoma are treated with the same regimine. Note that MGMT expression or MMR deficiency both confer resistance to temozolomide, but the drug is still used in these cases. Recent trails have shown potential benefit for lomustine/temozolomide combination in young, fit patients with MGMT methylations but superior efficacy has yet to be proven. 

Overall, glioblastoma has a very poor prognosis with a survival rate of 14.8% at 2 years and only 2.6% at 10 years.

### Tumor related Epilepsy

Younger age, higher KPS score and tumor location (see below [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813191/)) are associated with seizures before and after operation. Early post-operative seizure (<21d) is associated with poorer survival.

![Tumor Location](/img/tumor_seizures.jpg)

Epileptic activity is confirmed via EEG. The waveforms of the 7 major epieptiform EEG complexes are shown below:

![EEG](/img/EEG.png)

_A) Spike wave, B) spike and slow wave complex, C) sharp wave, D) sharp and slow wave complex, E) polyspike complex, F) polyspike and slow wave complex, G) spike rhythm discharges_

### Case Medications
- **Temozolomide**: prodrug of the imidazotetrazine class that requires nonenzymatic hydrolysis at physiological pH in vivo to perform alkylation of adenine/guanine residues, leading to DNA damage through futile repair cycles and eventual cell death. Temozolomide treatment is associated with myelosuppression, which is likely to be more severe in females and geriatric patients. 
    - It can cross the blood brain barrier and methylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine (N7-MeG, 70%), the N3 position of adenine (N3-MeA, 9%), and the O6 position of guanine (O6-MeG, 6%). Although more prevalent, N7-MeG and N3-MeA are rapidly repaired by the base excision repair pathway and are not primary mediators of temozolomide toxicity, although N3-MeA lesions are lethal if not repaired. By comparison, repair of O6-MeG requires action by the suicide enzyme methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl group to restore guanine. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis
- **Levetiracetam**: anticonvulsant agent used as an adjunct medication to manage partial onset, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with epilepsy. Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS. Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.

## Ethical Considerations of End of Life Care

The ethical principles recognized universal are autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7958189/)
- **Autonomy**: At the end of life, the priority of making decisions belongs to the patient. If the patient has lost the ability to make decisions, decisions are made according to the patient’s AD, if any. The proxy health care is second in decision-making on behalf of the patient. If no AD or proxy, the decision-making is up to the family members.
- **Beneficence and nonmaleficence** require physicians to defend the most useful intervention for a given patient. Often, patients’ wishes about end-of-life care are not expressed through ADs, and the patients’ health care providers and family members may not be aware of their wishes about end-of-life care. In this position, physicians must encourage intervention most beneficial to the patient.
- **Justice** physicians should strive for fair distribution of health resources and remain impartial in the delivery of health services. Futile medical care should be avoided whenever possible.


### Common scenarios:
1. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): DNR should be considered for those who may not benefit, paitents for whom CPR will cause permanent damage or loss of conciousness, or patients who are unlikley to recover post-CPR
2. Mechanical ventilation (MV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and mechanical circulatory support (MCS):  if MV, ECMO, or MCS support does not provide any benefit to the patient or no longer meets its intended goals, or if the outcome is not optimal, or the quality of life is not acceptable according to the patient’s or family’s wishes, support can be terminated.
3. Artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH): competent adults may refuse artificial nutrition and hydration
4. Terminal sedation: permissible when the patient is terminal, severe unresponsive and intolerable symptoms are present, a DNR is in effect, and death is imminent (hours to days)
5. Withholding and withdrawing treatment
6. Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS)

_Note_: There are two hypes of DRN orders. An In-Hospital DNR order tells hospital staff not to resuscitate you. An Out-of-Hospital DNR order instructs emergency medical personnel, hospital emergency room staff, nursing home staff, and other health care professionals not to resuscitate you.
