## TORCH Infections

TORCH infections are maternal illness during pregnancy that are tranmitted to the fetus either transplacentally or during the birthing process. This often results in miscarriage or stillbirth but can also result in fetal abnormalities.

### Toxoplasma gondii

Protozoa that commonly lives in cats. The oocytes are shed in stool and can infect human via fecal-oral transmission or ingestion of cysts in infected meat.

Maternal primary infection is usually asymptomatic (80-90%) in immunocompetnent mothers. Lymphadenopathy, fevers, chills, and sweats may occur. Latent infections do _not_ affect the fetus (only **primary infections**). Diagnosis is via IgM (first week) and IgG (peak 6-8 weeks into infection).

The **classic fetal traid** consists of:
- Hydrocephalus
- Chorioretinitis
- Intracranial calcifications (can be seen on prenatal US imaging)

Even normal appearing babies can be at risk of long term sequalae such as seizures and blindness.

### Syphilis

Spirochete bacteria transmitted via sexual contact. Maternal symptoms are the same as in a usual infection: primary chancre followed by maculopapular rash +/- lymphadenopathy, alopecia, and condyloma lata.

Findings in the baby can be early (<2yrs.):
- Maculopapular rash
- Chronic severe runny nose
- Abnormal long bones (especially in the legs, many abnormalities reported)
Or late (>2yrs.):
- Saddle nose, hearing loss/deafness
- Hutchinson teeth and mulberry molars
- Saber shins (bowed legs)
- Other scars due to gumma formation

### Varicella Zoster Virus

Herpes virus (DNA). Maternal infection can only be passed to fetus if **primary** (e.g. chickenpox, not shingles).

Newborns present with:
- Scars in dermatomal pattern
- Microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and/or seizures
- Cataracts and nystagmus
- Limb atrophy/hypoplasia
- Long term: **learning disability and low IQ**

### Parvovirus B19

Non-enveloped, ssDNA virus. Classically causes 5th disease in children. Adults with Parvovirus classically develop arthritis in hands, wrists, knees, and ankles. It infects RBC progenitors causing mild anemia in most individuals or severe anemia in those with sickle cell or other RBC turnover disorders.

Fetuses in the womb require expanding RBC volume, have shorter RBC half-life, and have an immature immune system. This makes infection particularly problematic and often results in spontaneous abortion.

Infection during pregnancy can cause **hydrops fetalis**: fluid accumulation in fetus (ascities, pleural, etc.). This can be diagnosed via ultrasound and must be distinguished from other potential etiologies such as immune hydrops (from Rh mismatch) and severe thalessemias.

### Rubella

RNA virus spread via respiratory droplets. Typically causes mild, self-limited illness with maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and joint pain in the mother. Newborns will present with _congenital rubella syndrome_:
- Sensorineual deafness
- Cataracts
- Congenital heart malformations (especially PDA)
- Blueberry muffin rash (purpuric skin lesions due to extramedullary hematopoiesis)
    - This rash can also be seen in congenital toxoplasmosis and CMV

Congenital rubella is very rare in the US due to rubella vaccines.

### CMV [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10687293/)

Herpes virus (DNA). Can be transmitted via sexual contact, breastmilk, bloood or organ products, or close contact of infected individuals (such as family members or at daycare). The virus then primarily replicates in monocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells but secondarily replicates in the spleen and liver.

Primary infection is asymptomatic in 90% of cases but can lead to a mononucleosis-like syndrome including rhinitis, pharyngitis, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias.

Congentical CMV has an estimated pooled overall prevalence ranging from 0.48% in high-income countries to 1.42% in low/middle-income countries. Approximatley 30-35% of primary maternal cases will result in fetal infection without treatment while reactivation or re-infection with another strain will only result in cCMV about 1-3% of the time.

Neonatal infection leads to **sensorineural hearing loss**. CMV is the leading infectious cause of congential sensorineural deafness and is the **most common congential infection** overall. Most babies are otherwise asymptomatic, only diagnosed after a failed hearing screen. Other potential findings include:
- Small for gestational age
- Microcephaly
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Blueberry muffin rash
- Seizure
- Intracranial calcifications (typically periventricular)

![MRI Rubella](/img/CMV_calcifications.jpeg)
    _Classic periventricular intracranial calcifications_

Brain injury induced by CMV congenital infection may be the result of uncontrolled viral replication, immune-mediated damage by cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and, in the presence of placental insufficiency, fetal hypoxia.

The majority of children with cCMV do not develop any consequences related to the infection. However, moderate to severe long-term impairment is diagnosed in almost 25% of infected children considered as a whole. This prevalence is even higher among those who are symptomatic at birth (50%â€“70%), frequently presenting as hearing loss (69), neurological disability, i.e., cerebral palsy (70) (up to 10% of all cases are due to CMV), and delayed psychomotor development. An overall mortality rate was reported as 0.5%.The main predictor of long-term sequelae is the gestational age at maternal infection (see table below).

#### Diagnosis of fetal infection

CMV DNA detected by PCR in a sample of amniotic fluid is the gold standard for the diagnosis of fetal infection. Prenatal diagnosis is performed when MPI is revealed by maternal symptoms or following prenatal serology screening or when the prenatal ultrasound is suggestive of fetal infection. In neonates, a confirmed diagnosis of cCMV is based on positive CMV DNA PCR in urine or saliva collected within 3 weeks of life.

#### CMV Hearing Loss

CMV damages the whole cochlea, affecting equally high and low frequencies (base and apex of the cochlea, respectively).

The possibility of late-onset hearing loss, progression, improvement, and fluctuation of hearing threshold make it very difficult to predict outcome and standardize follow-up of infected children. The risk for developing SNHL was reported between 12% and 20%.

#### Prevention

Toddlers show prolonged viral shedding for weeks or even months and are a significant source of infection in women and therefore a risk for cCMV infection in their offspring. Hygienic measures aim to avoid direct contact with the saliva and urine of young children that are the most common sources of infection in pregnant women.

#### Treatment

Ganciclovir (GCV) or its prodrug valganciclovir (VGCV) is the preferred antiviral agent for treating congenital CMV disease (and not only infection). In fact, at present, antiviral therapy with (val)ganciclovir is restricted to neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease involving the central nervous system.

### Herpes Simplex

The incidence of congenital HSV infection is estimated to range between 1 in 3000 and 1 in 20,000 live births. HSV is transmitted to a neonate most commonly during birth through an infected maternal genital tract but can be caused by an ascending infection through ruptured or intact amniotic membranes. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507897/)

HSV-2 is a lipid enveloped dsDNA virus that typically infects the genitals. Vaginal lesions present at birth can lead to infection of the fetus during the birthing process. 

Neonates can develop vesicles on the skin, near the eyes, and in the mouth. It may spread to CNS and disseminate to multiple organs leading to sepsis-like syndromes with negative bacterial culture. Women with active lesions at the time of labor are often offered C-sections to avoid this complication.

### Other Vertically Transmitted Infections

Vertical transmission is not limited to TORCH infections. Listeria, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and Zika virus can also be transmitted to the fetus and cause a variety of issues including the following:

#### Listeria
**Complications**: Listeria monocytogenes can cross the placenta and infect the fetus, leading to complications such as spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and even stillbirth. Infected newborns may exhibit symptoms like fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, and poor feeding.

**Treatment/Prevention**: Treatment involves antibiotic therapy, typically with ampicillin or penicillin, often combined with gentamicin. Prevention includes avoiding high-risk foods like unpasteurized dairy products, deli meats, and smoked seafood, and maintaining proper food hygiene during pregnancy.

#### HIV
**Complications**: HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breastfeeding, leading to pediatric HIV infection. Without treatment, infected infants can develop severe immunodeficiency, leading to opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, and neurological impairments.

**Treatment/Prevention**: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the mother during pregnancy and for the infant after birth significantly reduces the risk of transmission. Preventive measures include routine HIV testing during pregnancy, planned cesarean delivery for women with high viral loads, and avoiding breastfeeding if safe alternatives are available.

#### Hepatitis C Virus (HepC)
**Complications**: Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) can result in chronic hepatitis C infection in the newborn, which may progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma later in life. Infants with chronic HCV often remain asymptomatic for years.

**Treatment/Prevention**: Currently, there are no specific antiviral treatments for pregnant women with HCV to prevent vertical transmission. Prevention strategies focus on routine screening of pregnant women, avoiding invasive procedures during delivery, and considering antiviral treatment postpartum if necessary. Breastfeeding is generally considered safe unless the mother has co-infection with HIV or cracked, bleeding nipples.

#### Zika Virus
**Complications**: Zika virus infection during pregnancy can lead to severe congenital anomalies, including microcephaly, brain abnormalities, eye defects, hearing loss, and growth restriction. These complications are collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome.

**Treatment/Prevention**: There is no specific antiviral treatment for Zika virus; management is supportive. Prevention focuses on avoiding mosquito bites in endemic areas by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. Pregnant women are advised to avoid travel to areas with active Zika transmission.

### Pharmacology
- **Valgangciclovir and ganciclovir**: Ganciclovir, a nucleoside analog, disrupts viral DNA synthesis through selective incorporation of ganciclovir triphosphate, which terminates DNA chain elongation. Ganciclovir resistance, which is associated with mutations in cytomegalovirus (CMV) phosphotransferase and DNA polymerase, is seen mainly among immunocompromised patients receiving prolonged therapy.
- Both drugs are associated with leukopenia and general bone marrow supression. Renal insufficiency is also possible but is generally not a huge issue.

## Labor and its Complications

Labor and delivery (**_parturition_**) is caused by high levels of progesterone and subseuqnt relaxin production by the placenta that results in cervical softening and lengthining of the cervix and pubic symphysis. Prostaglandins are secreted in response to oxytocin and contribute to oxytocin receptor increase, cervical maturation, and synchronous contractions. Signs of impending labor include;
- Lightening: fetal rotation so head faces downward
- Blood-tinged vaginal mucus
- Increase in vaginal discharge

Usually, vaginal exam can determine membrane rupture and confirm that labor has started. However, litmus paper can be used to test fluid pH and will turn blue if the fluid contains amniotic fluid, which is alkaline.

**Braxton Hicks contractions** are not a sign of labor. Instad, they are weak, irregular contractions most common in the third trimester that do not increase in intensity or frequency.

The four stages of labor are:

### Early Labor and Dilation
- 6-12hr or more
- Relativley weak contractions for 10-30 seconds at wide intervals (15-30 minutes) which progress to stronger and more rapid contractions
- Rapid cervical change in the active phase from 3-6cm dilating 2-3cm/hr until full dilation of 10cm is reached

### Expulsion
- 30min-2hr
- Epidural may be used for pain relief
- Movement of baby through birth canal, ideally in occiuput anterior position (head down and body facing mother's back). The baby may also be in occiput posterior, though birth is more difficult
    - Vaginal deliver is _unsafe_ if the baby is in oblique or breech positions

![Cardinal movements of labor](/img/labor_movements.webp)
    _Cardinal movements of labor_

### Placental Phase
- Begins at delivery of infant and ends at expulsion of placenta and fetal membranes (afterbirth)
- 5-30min
- Can be accelerated by pharmacologic oxytocin

### Recovery
- Highest risk for postpartum hemorrhage and eclampsia
- Uterine contractions may still occur during breatfeeding for 48-72 hours post delivery
- Massive fluid shifts due to low blood volume can cause headache and BP fluctuations.
- Blood and fluid discharge from the uterus (lochia) is normal for a few weeks post-delivery

### Indications for C-section [[ref]](https://exchange.scholarrx.com/brick/normal-labor-and-delivery)

* Abnormal fetal presentation, such as transverse or breech.
* Failure to progress in labor despite all medical interventions.
* Suspected fetal asphyxia (inadequate oxygen) or fetal acidosis (abnormally high level of acid in the blood and body fluids).
* Previous cesarean delivery. This indication is due to the increased risk of uterine rupture, although trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) may be attempted with proper monitoring.
* Less common urgent indications include acute maternal or fetal disease, a complication such as eclampsia, and seizures or coma in a woman who has had preeclampsia (high blood pressure and signs of liver or kidney damage during pregnancy).
* Uterine rupture.
* Fetal bradycardia (deceleration of fetal heart rate without recovery).
* Umbilical cord prolapse; the cord slips ahead of the presenting part of the fetus and protrudes through the cervix or vagina.

### APGAR Score

![APGAR](/img/APGAR.png)

Apgar scoring is indicated in all newborn infants at 1 and 5 minutes and should be documented in the clinical record. In infants scoring <7, expanded Apgar score recording is encouraged by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy of Pediatrics as a method of monitoring response to resuscitation [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470569/).

Mortality is significantly increased among newborns with low Apgar scores (54% vs 26% in the 23- to 28-week stratum, 30% vs 6% in the 29- to 34-week stratum). Newborns with low Apgar scores in the 29- to 34-week stratum more often require intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and umbilical vessel catheterization. Newborns with low Apgar scores have higher rates of bradycardia, pneumothoraces, acidosis, and increased oxygen requirement during the first 6 to 8 hours of life. [[ref]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/348903)

### Fetal monitoring [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589699/)

Continuous fetal monitoring, or cardiotocography, is a method of tracking the fetal heart rate (FHR) along with the occurrence of uterine contractions. The relationship between these two variables is widely accepted to correlate with the oxygenation status of the fetus. During the first two stages of labor, fetal circulation is subject to compression as the fetus changes position and as uterine contractions occur, and this has the potential to lead to hypoxia and/or acidosis, which may induce fetal distress predisposing to poor outcomes. Typically, external fetal heartrate monitoring is not indicated for low-risk pregnancy. 

Normal fetal heart rate is 110/min-160/min. An acceleration, which is an increase in heart rate of â‰¥15/min above the baseline rate for longer than 15 seconds, is a reassuring sign. Accelerations that occur at least twice within 20 minutes typically indicate that the fetus is healthy and not in distress.

Three types of decelerations (decreases in heart rate) occur during labor [[ref]](https://exchange.scholarrx.com/brick/normal-labor-and-delivery): 

* **Early decelerations**: begin and end with contractions. They represent head compression. Head compression during contractions can increase vagal tone, causing a parasympathetic response of bradycardia in the fetus.
* **Late decelerations**: begin at the peak of a contraction and return to baseline sometime after the contraction ends. Late decelerations are a worrisome sign and indicate uteroplacental insufficiency.
* **Variable decelerations**: decreases in fetal heart rate at any time, unrelated to contractions. Variable decelerations are caused by cord compression, which can occur during labor after membranes have ruptured and there is less amniotic fluid to serve as a cushion.

FHR is divided into three categories:
- **I**: normal baseline FHR with moderate variability and no variable or late decelerations (_normal_)
- **II**: tachycardia, bradycardia, or reduced/marked variablity and/or occasional variable or late decelerations. Prompt evaluation of maternal disorders and repositioning onto the dise to increase fetal perfusion. Persistent abnormalities may indicate fetal issues.
- **III**: include at least one of the following findings: absent variability with bradycardia, absent variability with recurrent late and/or variable decelerations, or a sinusoidal pattern. Predictive of significant hypoxia or acidosis with associated neurologic injury. Fetal stimulation, maternal repositioning, tocolytics, and expiditied delivery are warranted if there are not contraindications.

### IUGR and SGA

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an abnormal fetal growth pattern that occurs in approximately 8% to 10% of pregnancies and is associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality. IUGR refers to an impoverished fetal growth with fetal, maternal, or placental causes (ie, congenital or chromosomal anomalies, infections, and vascular disorders) of a detrimental cascade in which oxygen reduction (up to hypoxemia) and nutritional deficiencies lead to cardiovascular deterioration, extreme blood flow resistance, and decreased fetal growth rate. In pregnancies in which IUGR occurs, the fetus attempts to prevent damage by slowing its growth and shortening its gestation; however, the adaptive responses to cope with in utero malnutrition have long-lasting consequences associated with adverse developmental and health-related outcomes throughout life.

Small for gestational Age (SGA) on the other hand, is simply a term for newborns with a birth weight of less than 10th percentile for gestational age. These infants can be constitutionally normal or be SGA due to growth restriction. Only the latter category is associated with incresed risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity.

### Postpartum complications
- **Postpartum Hemorrhage**: Leading cause of maternal death. Most often caused by uterine atony. Requires immediate IV fluid and blood transfusions along with oxytocin.
- **Postpartum Depression**: Up to 15% of women with experience profoiund emotional distress due to lack of stress and shifts in hormone levles. Treat with psychotherapy and antidepressants.
- **Postpartum Psychosis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544304)**: Rare but serious form of extreme confusion, paranoia, delusion, and hallucination following delivery. Increased risk with history of BPD or schizoid disorders. Treated with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics.
