## Meta Analysis

| Concept | Definition |
|---|---|
| Meta-analysis | Statistical analysis that integrates results from 2 or more studies providing<br>a single numerical value of the overall treatment effect for that group of studies |
| Effect size | A dimensionless estimate (ie, a measure with no units) that indicates both direction<br> and magnitude of the treatment effect |
| Odds ratio | he odds the ratio of the probability of an event occurring compared to the event<br> not occurring in a particular group. The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds between<br> 2 groups |
| Relative risk | Relative risk is equal to the risk among exposed subjects divided by the risk among<br> unexposed subjects |
| Fixed-effects model | A model that assumes that each study included in the meta-analysis is estimating the<br> same population treatment effect, which, in theory, represents the true population<br> treatment effect |
| Random-effects model | model that assumes that the treatment effects of the included studies are part of<br>a distribution of treatment effects that fall along a range of values |
| Forest Plot | A graph that visually shows the results from the individual studies (treatment<br> effect and confidence interval), as well as the estimate of overall treatment<br> effect and associated confidence interval |
| Confidence interval | Confidence intervals (CIs) provide upper and lower limits that capture the range<br> of values around the true but unknown population value. The 95% CI is most<br> commonly used and corresponds with the typical 5% significance level used in<br> hypothesis tests. CIs of continuous measures that include 0 represent<br> nonsignificant results. CIs of odds ratios and relative risk that include 1.0<br> represent nonsignificant results |
