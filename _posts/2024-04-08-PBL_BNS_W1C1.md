## The Spine

Neuronal pathways in the spine can be broadly categorized into ascending tracts (sensory) and descending tracts (motor)

![Spinal Tracts](/img/Spinal_tracts.svg)

### The Ascending Tracts

The dorsal column-medial lemniscal (DCML) pathway carries _fine touch, vibration, and proprioception_ information via the dorsal columns in the spine and medial lemniscus in the brainstem. It consists of 3 groups of neurons:
 - **First order neurons**: Carry info from peripheral nerves to the medulla oblongata. T6 and above (upper limb) travel in the lateral dorsal column (_fasciculus cuneatus_) and synapse in the nucleus cuneatus while T7 and below travel in the medial dorsal column (_fasciulus gracilis_) and synapse in the nucleus gracilis of the medulla oblongata. These neurons are pseudounipolar
- **Second order neurons**: Beginning in the nuclues cuneatus or gracilis, these neurons cross to the other side of the medulla oblongata (known as _decussation_) and deliver info to the **third order neurons** in the thalamus

The anterolateral system consists of the **anterior spinothalamic tract** (crude touch and pressue) and **lateral spinothalamic tract** (pain and temperature) each of which has 3 groups of neurons. The first order neurons enter and asend 1-2 vertebral levels before synapsing at the type of the dorsal horn at the _substantia gelatinosa_. The second order neurons then immediatley decussate and then form the two distinct tracts above that run alongside one another before carrying signals up to the thalamus.

The **spinocerebellar tracts** are 4 pathways which carry proprioceptive information from the lower limbs (posterior and anterior spinocerebellar tracts) and upper limbs (cuneocerebellar and rostral spinocerebellar tracts) to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Note that the anterior spinocerebellar tract decussate twice.

### The Descending Tracts

The **pyramidal tracts** originate in the cerebral cortex and carry motor fibers to the spinal cord and brain stem to control voluntary muscles of the body and face. 
 - The **corticospinal tracts** supply the body and recive input from the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area and pass through the internal capsule, through the crus cerebri, pons, and medulla. The tract then divides into the _lateral corticospinal tract_ which decussates and supply body muscles via the **ventral horn** and the _anterior corticospinal tract_ which remains ipsilateral and terminate in the ventral horn of the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae.
 - The **corticobulbar tracts** originate from the primary motor cortex and terminate on the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves supplying the motor function to the face and neck. Most nerves innervate bilateral facial regions, but CNVII (_facial_) is contralateral in the lower quadrant of the face and CNXII (_hypoglossal_) is contralateral.

The **extrapyramidal tracts** originate in the brainstem and are responsible for involuntary and autonomic control. There are four tracts: 
1. **Vestibulospinal:** medial and lateral pathways controlling balance and posture ipsilaterally by innervating antagonists against gravity.
2. **Reticulospinal:** medial (pro-voluntary, pro-tone) and lateral (anti-voluntary, anti-tone) tracts
3. **Rubrospinal**: contralateral fine hand control
4. **Tectospinal**: cordinate head movement in response to visual stimuli

## Spinal Cord Injuries

Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) vs. Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) injuries: 

### Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS)

* **Treatment** 
    * Emergent decompression surgery
    * Established rehab protocol
    * Investigational nerve stimulators, injections
* **Progression**
