## The Spine

Neuronal pathways in the spine can be broadly categorized into ascending tracts (sensory) and descending tracts (motor)

![Spinal Tracts](/img/Spinal_tracts.svg)

### The Ascending Tracts

The dorsal column-medial lemniscal (DCML) pathway carries _fine touch, vibration, and proprioception_ information via the dorsal columns in the spine and medial lemniscus in the brainstem. It consists of 3 groups of neurons:
 - **First order neurons**: Carry info from peripheral nerves to the medulla oblongata. T6 and above (upper limb) travel in the lateral dorsal column (_fasciculus cuneatus_) and synapse in the nucleus cuneatus while T7 and below travel in the medial dorsal column (_fasciulus gracilis_) and synapse in the nucleus gracilis of the medulla oblongata. These neurons are pseudounipolar
- **Second order neurons**: Beginning in the nuclues cuneatus or gracilis, these neurons cross to the other side of the medulla oblongata (known as _decussation_) and deliver info to the **third order neurons** in the thalamus

![DCML Pathway](/img/DCML_pathway.jpg)
    [_Image Source_](http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6/)

The anterolateral system consists of the **anterior spinothalamic tract** (crude touch and pressue) and **lateral spinothalamic tract** (pain and temperature) each of which has 3 groups of neurons. The first order neurons enter and asend 1-2 vertebral levels before synapsing at the type of the dorsal horn at the _substantia gelatinosa_. The second order neurons then immediatley decussate and then form the two distinct tracts above that run alongside one another before carrying signals up to the thalamus.

The **spinocerebellar tracts** are 4 pathways which carry proprioceptive information from the lower limbs (posterior and anterior spinocerebellar tracts) and upper limbs (cuneocerebellar and rostral spinocerebellar tracts) to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Note that the anterior spinocerebellar tract decussate twice.

### The Descending Tracts

The **pyramidal tracts** originate in the cerebral cortex and carry motor fibers to the spinal cord and brain stem to control voluntary muscles of the body and face. 
 - The **corticospinal tracts** supply the body and recive input from the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area and pass through the internal capsule, through the crus cerebri, pons, and medulla. The tract then divides into the _lateral corticospinal tract_ which decussates and supply body muscles via the **ventral horn** and the _anterior corticospinal tract_ which remains ipsilateral and terminate in the ventral horn of the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae.
 - The **corticobulbar tracts** originate from the primary motor cortex and terminate on the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves supplying the motor function to the face and neck. Most nerves innervate bilateral facial regions, but CNVII (_facial_) is contralateral in the lower quadrant of the face and CNXII (_hypoglossal_) is contralateral.

The **extrapyramidal tracts** originate in the brainstem and are responsible for involuntary and autonomic control. There are four tracts: 
1. **Vestibulospinal:** medial and lateral pathways controlling balance and posture ipsilaterally by innervating antagonists against gravity.
2. **Reticulospinal:** medial (pro-voluntary, pro-tone) and lateral (anti-voluntary, anti-tone) tracts
3. **Rubrospinal**: contralateral fine hand control
4. **Tectospinal**: cordinate head movement in response to visual stimuli

## Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201718)

Traumatic SCI is most common in males (about 80% of all SCI) is primarily due to motor vehicle collisions, falls, and sports-related injuries. Spinal degenerative changes such as cervical myelopathy predispose patients to SCI.

### General Pathophysiology

Disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier results in axon disruption, hemorrhage, edema, pro-apoptotic signaling, and inflammatory reponses. After about 2 days, thrombosis, cystic cavitation, infiltration with inflammatory cells and microglia alongsize further demyelination and astrogliosis cause further damage. This can be exaggerated due to glutamate release from dying neurons and astrocytes, which causes NMDA overactivation and resulting ion pump dysfunction and further neuronal death. In the chronic phase (2 weeks - 6 months), the astroglial scar develops and further restricts regeneration.

Historically, endogenous regeneration of damaged tissue was thought to be impossible. However, precursor cell pools at the ependymal layer may  allow for limited regrowth given adequate neuroprotective and regenerative support.

_Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) vs. Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) injuries_: The upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex and travel down to the brain stem or spinal cord, while the lower motor neurons begin in the spinal cord and go on to innervate muscles and glands throughout the body. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554616/)
- **UMN Lesion**: hyperreflexia, spasticity, and a positive Babinski reflex (upward response of the big toe when the plantar surface of the foot is stroked with other toes fanning out)
- **LMN Lesion**: hyporeflexia, flaccid paralysis, and atrophy.

### Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) [[ref]](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/brown-sequard-syndrome-1?lang=us)

Most often observed in patients with penetrating (gunshot/knife wound) SCI. Can also occur after MVA, tumors, vertebral artery dissection, spinal hemorrhage, radiation therapy, and demyelination.

**Ipsilateral** deficits include: spastic paralysis below the lesion, loss of light touch, proprioception, and vibration. All motor and snesory funciton are lost at the level of the injured segment

**Contralateral** deficits include pain and temperature sensation lost 2-3 levels below the lesion

* **Diagnosis**: MRI is the modality of choice. Compressed or damaged cord will show as a focal hyperintense T2 hemicord lesion at the level of injury.
* **Treatment**: _Time is spine_
    * Trauma patients should follow the ATLS guidelines for evaluation as detailed in a later section
    * Complete immobilization of the cranio-spinal axis via use of c-collar and spine board should be maintained until confirmation of spinal stability
    * Emergent decompression surgery: relief of bony or ligamentous compression via open reduction and decompression with instrumented fusion to stabilize the spinal column in an anatomical position.

### Anterior cord syndrome (ACS) [[ref]](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ventral-cord-syndrome)

AKA Ventral cord syndrome. Encompasses all causes of damage to the anterior spinal cord regardless of etiology. Most commonly due to ischemia/infarction of the anterior spinal artery (known as anterior spinal artery syndrome or Beck's syndrome). Other causes include aortic aneurysim/dissection, hernated disk, spinal tumor, epidural collections,and trauma.

Clinically, the syndrome presents with:

* Complete motor paralysis below the level of the lesion due to involvement of the anterior horn cells and corticospinal tracts
* Loss of pain and temperature at and below the level of injury due to involvement of spinothalamic tracts
* Autonomic dysfunction: orthostatic hypotension due to involvement of lateral horn cells 6
* Bladder and bowel dysfunction and sexual dysfunction may arise depending on the level of the lesion

2-point discrimination, proprioception and vibratory senses are normal due to intact posterior columns and posterior grey matter. 

MRI is the imaging of choice. In many instances, the anterior horn cells are primarily involved and demonstrate prominent high T2 signal resulting in pencil-like hyperintensities extending over a number of levels. On axial imaging, this appears as two bright dots, the so-called owl eye appearance.

ACS has the worst prognosis of all spinal cord injury syndromes and is associated with high mortality and poor functional outcomes.

### Central cord syndrome (CCS)

The most common incomplete SCI accounting for 15-25% of all SCI. It is often diagnosed in patients with pre-existing spondylosis and characterized by disproportionate motor impairment of the upper limbs in a "cape" distribution, bladder dysfunction, and varying sensory loss.

Smaller lesions cause bilateral pain and temperature loss at the affected level. Larger lesions result in UMN pattern deficits below the injury level and LMN at the level. Motor dysfunction predominates.

CT may not pick up lesions, so MRI is the preffered imaging:
* _T1_: the affected region is usually of isointense signal compared to rest of cord or slightly hypointense
* hemorrhagic contusion may have areas of high T1 signal
* _T2_: increased signal centrally within the cord at the affected level (edema/contusion)
* hemorrhagic contusions will have variable signal with areas of low T2 eventually becoming apparent
* _T2* - SWI/GE_: will show low signal and blooming if blood product 

### Posterior cord syndrome (PCS)

Rare syndrome typically caused by posterior spinal artery occlusion. The injury results in a unilateral dorsal cord syndrome characterized by an isolated loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation bilaterally below the lesion.

### Conus medullaris syndrome (CMS)

Typically due to injury (herniated disk, vertebral fracture, tumors, or vascular/infectious lesions) at the level of T12-L2 presenting with:
 - Severe back pain
 - Saddle anesthesia
 - Urinary retention
 - Bowel incontenence
 - Lower limb weakness, paresthesia, and numbness (mixed UMN/LMN unlike pure LMN defects with cauda equina syndrome)

### Cauda equina syndrome (CES) [[ref]](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n32)

Compression of the cauda equina causes loss of bladder and urethral sensation and altered saddle sensation along with intense low back pain. Decompression of the region before incontinence is critical to maintain function. Key symptoms (all due to LMN dysfunciton) include:
* Reduced awareness of bladder filling
* Loss of the urge to void
* Reduced awareness that micturition is occurring
* Inability to voluntarily interrupt the stream of urine in mid-flow
* Recent onset or progressively worsening weak urinary stream with terminal dribbling (this is obviously also common in men with bladder outflow obstruction and can occur with anticholinergic drugs)
* Loss of urethral sensation or altered sensation over the genitalia
* Some alteration of peri-anal sensation (a “numb bum” on wiping). There may also be perianal paraesthesia or pain

It would not be practical to refer all patients with low back pain and any urinary symptoms to the local emergency department or for an MRI scan. It is a subset of urinary symptoms (those that are not due to pain inhibition) that are suggestive of CES.

Bilateral leg weakness or flaccid paralysis may also result.

### Progression and Recovery of SCI

**Chronic complications** [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4303787/)
 - _Respiratory_: insufficiency of respiratory muscles, reduction in vital capacity, ineffective cough, reduction in lung and chest wall compliance and excess oxygen cost of breathing. This may result in atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Sleep related respiratory disorders are also a common issue.
 - _Cardiovascular_: thought to be primarily an issue with low levels of efferent sumpathetic nervous activity and spinal reflex mechanisms, complications include orthostatic hypotension, autonomic dysreflexia, impaired cardiovascular reflexes, reduced transmission of cardiac pain, loss of reflex cardiac acceleration, cardiac atrophy with tetraplegia due to loss of left ventricular mass and pseudo-myocardial infarction.
 - **Neurogenic bladder** may resut due to interupption of the pontine and sacral micturition centers (2/3 bladder regulators alongside the cerebral cortex). Neurogenic bladder can be divided into 4 clinical presentations:
    1. Hypereflexia of detrusor and sphincter with involuntary contractions, sphincter dyssynergia, reflex incontinence and residual urine
    2. Detrusor areflexia with sphincter areflexia. Patients experience stress incontinence and residual urine due to injury to sacral (S2-S4) anterior horn cells or their associated axons, which leads to impaired motor output to the bladder and decreased or absent detrusor contractility (flaccidity)
    3. Detrusor areflexia with sphincter hyperreflexia with overflow incontinence and urinary retention
    4. Detrusor hyperreflexia with sphincter areflexia with reflex incontinence
 - **Neurogenic bowel**: nearly half of patients with SCI suffer from impaired continence. UMN bowel syndrome increases colonic wall and anal tone, interrupting voluntary relaxation of the sphincter and leading to constipation and retention. LMN bowel syndrome is characterized by a lack of spinal-cord reflex peristalsis and slow stool propulsion along with incontinence due to denervation of the external anal sphincter and levator ani muscle.
 - _Spasticity_:  hypertonus, increased intermittent or sustained involuntary somatic reflexes (hyperreflexia), clonus and painful muscle spasms.
 - _Chronic pain_: nociceptive pain or neuropathic pain are common.
 - _Paralysis_: pressure ulcers, osteoporosis, and bone fracture due to immobility are common issues.
 
* **Recovery**

    The fastest rate of recovery usually happens during the first six months. But some people make small improvements for up to 1 to 2 years.

    * _Surgical Techniques_: Focus on spinal alignment, nerve decompression, and stabilization to prevent additional neurologic injury. Experimental approaches include building bridges across damaged spinal areas.
    * _Biological Therapy_: Involves factors promoting neuronal regeneration, stem cell transplantation, and precursor cell therapy to bridge damaged areas and stimulate axonal regeneration.
    * _Physical Means_: Utilize hypothermia, hyperbaric oxygen, and exercise to minimize secondary damage and promote recovery. Treadmill training shows improvement in recovery and neurological performance.
    * _Electrical Stimulation_: The use of electrical stimulation (ES) of the central and peripheral nervous system can take advantage of these intact neuromuscular systems to provide therapeutic exercise options, to allow functional restoration, and even to manage or prevent many medical complications following SCI. The use of ES for the restoration of upper extremity, lower extremity and truncal functions can make many activities of daily living a potential reality for individuals with SCI. Restoring bladder and respiratory functions and preventing pressure ulcers may significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality following SCI. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4519233/)
    * _Pharmacological Therapy_: Includes corticosteroids, gangliosides, antioxidants, and potassium channel blockers to prevent secondary SCI, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance nerve conduction.

* **Rehab**
    Spinal cord injuries are classified by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) by considering the motor and sensory functions.

    * ASIA-A (Complete): There is no sensory or motor function preserved in the sacral segments of S4-S5
    * ASIA-B (Sensory incomplete): Motor deficit without sensory loss below the neurological level, including the sacral segments of S4-S5 (light touch, pin sensation or deep anal pressure at S4-S5), and there is no protected motor function from three levels below the motor level at each half of the body
    * ASIA-C (Motor incomplete): Motor function is preserved below the neurological level1 and more than half of the muscles below this level have strength lower than 3/5 (0, 1 or 2)
    * ASIA-D (Motor incomplete): Motor function is preserved below the neurological level1 and at least half of the muscles (half or more) below this level have strength higher than 3/5
    * ASIA-E (Normal): Sensory and motor function as assessed by ISNCSC in all segments are normal and in patients with pre-existing deficits there is "E'' degree of ASIA. Initially one without a spinal cord injury does not have an ASIA degree

## Trauma

- **Glassgow Coma Scale (GCS)**
    ![GCS](/img/GCS-table.png)

### Initial Assessment [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1914302/)

- **Advanced trauma life support (ATLS)**: ABCDE
    * Airway and C-spine stabilization: 100% O2 through non-rebreather. Talking indicates uncompromised airway. Facial fractures, soft tissue injury to the neck, and coma all threaten the airway. Intubate if needed. Immobilize the C-spine in all cases until it is cleared by physical exam or imaging.
    * Breathing: immediatley treat tension pnemuothorax, massive hemothorax, flail thorax accompanied by pulmonary contusion, and open pneumothorax which can compromise breathing acutely.
    * Circulation: hemorrhage is the major cause of traumatic circulatory issues. BP and HR should be measured, and pulses at all distal exremities should be taken to ensure adequate blood flow. FAST exam and/or pelvic X-ray can reveal major concerning internal bleeds.
    * Disability: evaluated via the GCS detailed above
    * Environment and Exposure: hypothermia, burns, exposures to chemical/radioactive substances.
    * **Secondary survey**: consists of a head to toe examination with radiographs of the thoracic/lumbar spine and extremities when appropriate.
- **Neurological Evaluation**
    * Dysdiadochokinesia: inability to perform rapid alternating muscle movements such as opening/closing the fist, foot tapping, and finger tapping. It is demonstrated clinically by asking the patient to tap the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other, then rapidly turn over the fingers and tap the palm with the back of them, repeatedly. It is indicative of **cerebellar ataxia** and is a result of lesions to either the cerebellum or the frontal lobe.
    * Hemotympanum: presence of blood in the middle ear cavity that corresponds to purple discoloration or ecchymosis of the TM. Common causes of hemotympanum are temporal bone fractures, therapeutic nasal packing, epistaxis, blood disorders, anticoagulant therapy, otitis media, and barotrauma.
    * **Reflexes**

            _Deep Tendon Reflexes_
        ![Primitive Reflexes](/img/primitive_reflexes.png)

    * Ecchymosis to the spine: may signify spinal cord contusion (SCC), an injury caused by crushing of the cord with part of its tissue spared, particularly the ventral nerve fibers connecting the spinal cord rostral and caudal to the injury remain physically intact.
    * 2-point descrimination: tested with two sharp points during. Normally, a person should be able to recognize two points separated by 2 to 8 mm on fingertips. On the lips, it is 2 to 4 mm, and on the palms, it is 8 to 12 mm and 30–40 mm on the shins or back (assuming the points are at the same dermatome)

## Case medications

- **Fentanyl:** A synthetic opiod analgesic 50-100 times more potent than morphine. It is often used as a sedative for intubated patients and as a painkiller in patients with renal failure, as it is primarilly eliminated in the liver [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459275/)
    - Fentanyl is a Mu-selective opioid agonist with the capability to activate delta and potenitally kappa receptors as well. This results in analgesia and dopamine increase. 
    - Binding of Mu-receptors (GPCRs) in both the spinal cord and brainstem nuclei results in activation of descending inhibitory fibers, which modulate (block) the input and output of laminae I, II, V and VII nociceptor neurons [[ref]](https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/m/s2/chapter08.html).
    - Fentanyl is often added to heroin or other drugs and is a key culprit in overdose.
