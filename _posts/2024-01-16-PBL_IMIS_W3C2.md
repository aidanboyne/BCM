## Joints

Joints provide low friction articulations to enable movement of the body with minimal effort and are defined as the point at which two or more bones make contact. Most load occurs due to contraction of spanning muscles. The three histological classifications of joints are fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial which correspond to the three functional classifications of joints: synarthrosis (immovable), amphiarthrosis (slightly moveable), and diarthrosis (freely movable). 
- Fibrous: skull (suture), teeth (gomphoses), and syndemoses (slightly moveable i.e. tibiofibular and interosseous membrane of forearm)
- Sychondrosis (primary) cartilagenous: growth plate. Only temporary
- Symphysis (secondary) cartilagenous firbrocartilage i.e. pubic symphysis or intervertebral disks
- Synovial can be: hinge, saddle, planar, pivot, condyloid, and ball and socket. 

### Microscopic (histologic) description [[ref]](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/jointsnormalhistology.html)
* Articular cartilage
    * Hyaline: smooth, glistening; may be fibrous (e.g., temporomandibular and sternoclavicular joints)
    * Composed of chondrocytes (1% of volume), matrix water (70 - 80% wet weight) and a matrix macromolecular framework (collagen [chiefly type II collagen], hydrophilic proteoglycans, decoran, aggrecan and other noncollagenous proteins and glycoproteins)
    * Chondrocytes are dispersed within the extracellular matrix and reside in lacunae
    * Chondrocytes have pyknotic nulei and lack abundant nuclear detail
    * Clustering of chondrocytes (cloning) may be seen in degenerative and neoplastic conditions
    * 4 zones (from superficial to deep): gliding (superficial) zone, transitional zone, radial zone and calcified zone
        * Chondrocytes are flattened near the surface and more rounded elsewhere
        * Calcified zone stands out by virtue of calcification of its matrix; delineated from the broad radial zone by a wavy line (tidemark), along which the calcareous material is concentrated
        * Calcified zone is anchored to a layer of dense osseous tissue (bony end plate), which seals off the marrow cavity
* Synovium
    * Lines the remainder of the joint space
    * 2 layers: a thin intimal layer (1 - 3 synoviocytes in depth) and a deeper subintimal layer (vascular loose connective tissue with foci of fat)
* Synovial fluid
    * Clear and slightly yellow, viscid mucoid
    * Chemical composition similar to plasma, supplemented with hyaluronans
    * 200 - 300 cells/mm2 (synoviocytes, fibrochondrocytes, lymphocytes)
    * Intraarticular and extracapsular structures
    * May be incorporated into the joint capsule or form independent structures, poorly vascularized
* Ligament: bundles of collagen fibers (joined by proteoglycans) in an organized, hierarchical structure; connect bones to one another
* Tendon: similar histology to ligaments; connect muscles to bone
* Enthesis: the interface between bone and tendon / ligament
    * In polarized light, individual collagen fibers can be seen passing from the fibrous tissue at right angle to the bony endplate (Sharpey fibers)
    * Intermediary tissue may be fibrocartilage or hyaline cartilage
* Disk and meniscus: circular or semilunar collagenous connective tissue in certain joints (e.g., temporomandibular, knee)

## Joint Pain

### Gout

Clinical gout comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and tendons. Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ~9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/1999/0215/p925.html). High serum urate does not neccesarily cause gout and has a variety of causes including increased production (diet, myelo/lymphoproliferative disorders, cytotoxic drugs, obesity...) and decresased renal excretion (drugs such as cyclosporine, thiazides, furosemide..., HTN, renal failure, dehydration, hypothyroidism...).

Acute gout results in erythema, swelling, and pain, often of the first metatarsophalangeal joint in 30-50 y.o. patients. Gout in women only occurs after menopause. Tophi are chalky deposits of sodium urate that are large enough to be seen on radiographs and may occur at virtually any site. The most common sites include the joints of the hands or feet. The helix of the ear, the olecranon bursa and the Achilles tendon are classic, albeit less common, locations for tophi. 

Monosodium urate crystals are required for diagnosis and identified by examination under polarized light microscopy. In order to demonstrate the characteristic birefringence, it is necessary to use a microscope with a first-order red compensator and a rotating stage. Urate crystals are bright (strongly birefringent), needle shaped and yellow (negatively birefringent) when lying parallel to the axis of the compensator (an axis reference is usually etched into the housing of the compensator).

Urate lowering therapy should be initiated as follows:

![ULT](/img/ult_guidelines.PNG)

Allopurinol is reccomened in all patients over other ULTs. Low dose with titration is reccomended for allopurinol and febuxostat. Coinitiation of antiinflammatory prophylaxis i.e. cholchicine, NSAIDs or prednisone, is reccomended for at least 3-6 months. Target serum urate is typically set at <6 mg/dL. Unless the serum urate level is lower than 6.4 mg per dL (380 μmol per L), the concentration at which urate saturates the extra-cellular fluid, crystals will not be absorbed, and tophi will continue to form.

Patients who fail XOIs, urcosurics, and other interventions _with unresolving tophi or frequent flares_ should be switched to pegloticase. Otherwise pegloticase (which is expensive and has adverse effects) should not be initiated. Alcohol, purines, and high fructose corn syrup are all lifestyle risk factors and should be avoided. Weight loss is reccomended in overweight/obese patients. [[ref]](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltee37abb6b278ab2c/blt04d52e3b6ff5112f/632cab5b258fb55f6b2186af/gout-guideline-2020.pdf)

### Rheumatoid Arthritis [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2011/1201/p1245.html)

Older age, a family history of the disease, and female sex are associated with increased risk of RA, although the sex differential is less prominent in older patients. Cigarette smoking also increases risk. Parous women, women who breastfeed, and late menarche.

Pain and stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with activity in multiple joints (especially wrists, PIP, and MCP joints) are typical presenting symptoms.

[[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp20182)

Rheumatoid factor is not specific for RA and may be present in patients with other diseases, such as hepatitis C, and in healthy older persons. Anti-citrullinated protein antibody is more specific for RA and may play a role in disease pathogenesis.6 Approximately 50 to 80 percent of persons with RA have rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or both. Patients with RA may have a positive antinuclear antibody test result, and the test is of prognostic importance in juvenile forms of this disease. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are often increased with active RA, and these acute phase reactants are part of the new RA classification criteria. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may also be used to follow disease activity and response to medication.

RA is associated with a number of extra-artiular manifestations and increases risk for lymphoma twofold independent of any therapy. Many therapies, listed below, incerase patient risk for infection. Patients with RA live three to 12 years less than the general population, mainly attributable to accelerated progression of cardiovascular disease.

#### DMARDs

#### Other therapies.

NSAIDs and corticosteroids are ideally only used for short term therapy. Exercise and PT have been shown to improve QOL, though they have not been shown to slow disease progression. Joint replacement is indicated when there is severe joint damage and unsatisfactory control of symptoms with medical management. Long-term outcomes are good, with only 4 to 13 percent of large joint replacements requiring revision within 10 years The hip and knee are the most commonly replaced joints.


### Osteoarthritis [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201672)

The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is joint pain. The pain tends to worsen with activity, especially following a period of rest; this has been called the gelling phenomenon. Osteoarthritis can cause morning stiffness, but it usually lasts for less than 30 minutes, unlike rheumatoid arthritis, which causes stiffness for 45 minutes or more. The joints most commonly affected are the hands, knees, hips, and spine, but almost any joint can be involved. Osteoarthritis is often asymmetric. Among men and women, pain in structural hand OA is only present in ∼15% of cases, whereas ∼50% of patients with structural knee OA and an even greater proportion of those with structural hip OA experience pain. Risk factors include obesity, malalignment, and genetics.

Because osteoarthritis is primarily a clinical diagnosis, physicians can confidently make the diagnosis based on the history and physical examination. Plain radiography can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other conditions. Radiographs commonly show bony projections at the joint space (which are often narrowed) known as osteophytes. Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive and sensitive option. Crepitius on motition is a relativley good diagnostic clue as well. Histology will reveal fissuring and fragmentation of articular cartilage, proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes with duplication of the tidemark and vascular invasion. Molecular factors involved in OA joint destruction include IL-1,-6, and -15 along with TNF, inflammatory mediators (PGE2, NO...), MMPs (matrix metalloproteinsases), and others. Several key proteins in cell proliferation including FGF1,7, and 23 are upregulated to increase chondrocyte proliferation.

### Trauma
- ACL: test via anterior drawer. Excess laxity indicates tear. (add ant/post. valg/varus tests)
- PCL: test via posterior drawer. Excess laxity indicates tear.
- MCL: test via valgus stress. Excessive gapping at the medial joint and/or pain indicate damage.
- LCL: test via varus stress. Excessive gapping at the lateral joint and/or pain indicate damage.

## Pharmacology

### Gout
- Colchicine: inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization prevents the activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils associated with some gout symptoms. It may also interfere with activation of IL-1B. Highly associated with adverse GI symptoms. It is approved for prophylaxis and treatment of gouty flares. 
- Allopurinol: Xanthine oxidase inhibitor leading to lowered serum urate. Approved for gout, prevention of tumor lysis, and prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis in hyperuricosuria. Adverse reactions include macropapular pruritic rash, GI side effets, and SJS in severe cases (especially in those with HLA-B*58:01)

    ![URIC](/img/uric_acid_formation.png)

- Febuxostat: Xanthine oxidase inhibitor like allopurinol. Associated with much higher risk of cardiovascular mortality so is not used unless patients fail allopurinol or have severe adverse effects. Increased gout flares often occur at induction, so NSAIDs or cholchicine are reccomended during initiation and up to 6 months.
