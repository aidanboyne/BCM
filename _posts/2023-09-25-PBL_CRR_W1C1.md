## Diagnosis

### Wheezing differential [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2008/0415/p1109.html)
- Asthma, allergies, infections (bacterial or viral), GERD, and obstructive sleep apnea are most common causes. Congential abnormalities, foreign body aspiration, and CF are other possible causes.
- Response to bronchodilators can help differentiate
- CXR is needed in recurrent wheezing or unexplained wheezing refractory to bronchodilators

### Pediatric vitals (1-3yr) [[ref]](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/pediatric-vital-signs/)
- BP: 90-105/55-70 mmHg (**lower than adult**)
- HR: 80-125bpm (**higher than adult**)
- RR: 20-30 /min (**higher than adult**)
- Temperature of anything up to 100.4F can be normal. Temp > 104F is sign of serious and requires medical attention.

### Broncholitis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519506/) 

Broncholitis is an inflammator bronchial reaction almost always caused by a virus and more common in winter months. It is the most common cause of LRI in children under 2y.o. Usually results from RSV, a enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Can also be caused by adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza.

#### Risk factors
 - Preterm birth
 - Chronic lung disease (CLD)
 - Complicated congenital heart disease (CHD)
 - Immunodeficiency
 - Maternal smoking and home allergens are associated but without definitive evidence

#### Presentation

Runny nose, nasal congestion, lowered appetite, and cough for about 3 days. Worsening congestion can result in tachypnea, accessory respiratory engagement, and wheezing. High severity can present with grunting, nasal flaring, cyanosis, hypoxia, and respiratory failure. Fever is not always present. Viral ID can be done but primarily a clinical diagnosis. CXR not indicated.

#### Virus vs. Bacteria
- **Viral**: Gradual onset, preceding upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny nose, cough), fever (though not always), and wheezing or crackles on auscultation.
- **Bacterial**: Sudden onset, high fever, toxic appearance, and focal chest signs may be more common.

**Labs:**
- Complete Blood Count (CBC): Viral infections typically produce a normal or low white blood cell (WBC) count with lymphocytosis. Bacterial infections might produce an elevated WBC count with neutrophilia.
- C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin: These are markers of inflammation. Elevated levels can be seen in bacterial infections, but they can also rise in viral infections. Procalcitonin, in particular, is more elevated in bacterial infections than in viral ones and can serve as a useful marker.

If needed, rapid tests for virus can be used to distinguish. Viral LRT infections are also more likely to resolve without a high degree of intervention. 

## Pathophysiology

### Alveoli
- T1 Pneumocytes: Squamous epithelial. Optimal gas exchange. Include pores of Kohn between alveoli that allow air, fluid, phagocytes, and bacteria to bass. 
- T2 Pneumocytes: Cuboidal clusters. Secrete surfactant from _lamellar bodies_. Proliferate to form T1/T2 pneumocytes in case of damage.
    - Surfactant: starts at 20 weeks, survivable around 25 weeks, mature levels around 35 weeks. Require glucocorticoid stimulation.
- Macrophages

### Anatomy

![Respiratory Tree](/img/resp_tree.png)

- RL has 3 lobes with 2 fissures (horizontal and oblique). LL Has 2 lobes with single oblique fissure and lingula on superior lobe. Trachea split at **carina**. 

### Respiration

Inhalation possible due to **diaphragm** contraction. This muscle has 3 perforations: IVC + phrenic nn. at T8 at _caval opening_, esophagus and vagus nn. at T10 at _esophageal hiatus_, and aorta + thoracic duct + azygous v. at T12 at _aortic hiatus_. It is innervated by C3-5 (phrenic n.) and injury can result in referred pain to traps (3,4) and shoulder (5). 

Forced inspiration is augmented by the accessory muscles including the sternocleidomastoid, pectoralis minor and major, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, and serratus posterior superior muscles.

![Accessory Inhalers](/img/accessory_insp.jpg)

Expiration is usually passive due to elastic recoil of lungs and thoracic wall. However, internal and innermost intercostals along with abdominals and quadatus lumborum can increase alveolar pressure further in forced expiration.  

### Respiratory Immune System
- Nasal cavity 

### Viral Process
Begins in nasopharynx where it attaches to cells via RSV G protein incubates approximately 5 days before spreading to LRT. In infants, lower respiratory tract signs, such as tachypnea, wheezing, or rales, usually appear 1 to 3 days after the onset of rhinorrhea, representing viral spread into the bronchi and bronchioles. It can also spread between cells without entering interstitium via induction of syncytium formation in tissue.

During bronchiolitis, ciliated epithelial cells are destroyed, and in widespread bronchiolar epithelial necrosis is observed the most severe cases. In its severe form, lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV involves peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltrates accompanied by submucosal edema and bronchorrhea. These events lead to bronchiolar obstruction with patchy atelectasis and areas of compensatory emphysema.


### Inflammatory process [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88919)

1. **Direct Viral Damage**: Some respiratory viruses can directly infect the epithelial cells lining the bronchioles. This infection can lead to cell damage or death. As a result, the airway walls can become inflamed, leading to bronchiolar constriction. Common viruses that can cause this include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus, both of which are known to cause bronchiolitis in infants and young children.
2. **Inflammatory Response**: The body's immune response to the viral infection can lead to inflammation of the bronchioles. Immune cells release various inflammatory mediators, such as histamines, leukotrienes, and cytokines. These mediators can cause swelling of the airway lining and increased mucus production, both of which contribute to bronchiolar constriction.
3. **Increased Mucus Production**: Viral infections often stimulate the production of mucus in the respiratory tract. Excessive mucus can obstruct the small airways, leading to symptoms of bronchiolar constriction. This is particularly evident in conditions like bronchiolitis.
4. **Structural Differences in Pediatric Airway**: The airways of infants and young children are anatomically different from those of adults. They have narrower diameters and are more compliant (i.e., softer and more easily collapsible). This makes them more susceptible to obstruction from inflammation, mucus, or external compression.

_Specific Notes:_  Pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators and substances in the airway mucosa and submucosa, including IL-6, IL-11, ICAM-1, ECP, LTC4, LTD4, and histamine, may induce airway inflammation and smooth muscle contraction

## Treatment

### Broncholitis Treatment

Hydration, suction of upper airway, and monitoring in case of respiratory failure is indicated. Hypertonic saline nebulization is option and antipyretics used in case of fever. Bronchodilators, steroids, and ephinephrine are not reccomended. Extremely high risk patients (<29w preterm younger than 1yr and those with CLD or significand CHD) are indicated for palivizumab prophylaxis.

#### Acetaminophen [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482369/)

Acetaminophen, also called N-acetyl para-aminophenol (APAP) or paracetamol, has an MOA that is not fully understood. However, it is historically categorized along with NSAIDs because it inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. Like NSAIDs, acetaminophen has analgesic and antipyretic properties, but it lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory properties. Acetaminophen may inhibit the COX pathway in the central nervous system but not peripheral tissues. Additionally, acetaminophen does not appear to bind to the active site of either the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme; instead, it reduces the activity of COX by a different mechanism. Nonetheless, COX inhibition results in lowered CNS prostaglandins leading to analgesis and antipyresis. 

High dose acetaminophen use has been linked to liver failure and sometimes has led to liver transplants or death but is otherwise generally safe. Other serious reactions include Stevens-Johnson hypersensitivity. More common adverse effects include minor skin rash, minor nephrotoxicity, and metabolic/hematologic effects.

##### Metabolism and toxic effects
- Following therapeutic concentrations of oral acetaminophen, 60% to 90% of the drug gets metabolized in the liver to glucuronic acid- and sulfate-conjugate metabolites. A smaller fraction (approximately 5% to 15%) undergoes metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP450). Metabolism primarily via CYP2E1 results in the formation of the toxic intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). 
- Normally, NAPQI is neutralized by glutathione to nontoxic metabolites. However, with excessive doses of acetaminophen, the normal phase II drug metabolism pathways become depleted, and the CYP450 pathway metabolizes a higher portion of the acetaminophen taken, resulting in high concentrations of NAPQI formation, and the limited glutathione stores can become depleted. 

### Inappropriate Abx [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6440589/)

Up to 50% of antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed, the majority of which are for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 2 million illnesses and 23 000 deaths in the USA are caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. Antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in the outpatient setting account for almost half (44%) of the more than 266 million antibiotic prescriptions written each year in the USA, and is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance.

Resistance is only one side of issue - overuse of antibiotics exposes patients to the unnecessary risk of adverse drug events. In fact, antibiotics are the leading cause of adverse drug events accounting for nearly 24% of adverse drug events present on admission.

#### Why do we prescribe? [[ref]](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2017/06/30/why-doctors-prescribe-antibiotics-even-when-they-shouldnt)

1. **Patient satisfaction and pressure**. Patients or their families may expect to get a prescription at an office visit, whether or not an antibiotic is necessary. And even when there is no expectation of antibiotics from patients or their families, doctors may think there is. Studies show that physicians can be affected by this pressure—real or perceived—and as a result are more likely to prescribe antibiotics.
1. **Time constraints.** In outpatient settings, doctors often have limited time to see patients, diagnose their illnesses, and formulate a treatment plan. Interviews with doctors reveal that they may quickly prescribe antibiotics because they want to avoid lengthy explanations of why the drugs are not needed and because a shorter office visit allows them to see more patients. In at least one study of general practitioners, busier physicians who see more patients prescribed antibiotics at a higher rate than did their less busy colleagues.
2. **Decision fatigue**. The process of repeatedly diagnosing and treating large numbers of patients may also affect a doctor’s capacity to make consistent prescribing decisions. This decline in decision-making abilities after having to make repeated treatment choices is known as decision fatigue and may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic use. For example, a recent study showed that as their workdays wore on, physicians became significantly more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients with acute respiratory infections—conditions for which these drugs are only rarely recommended.
3. **Uncertain diagnoses**. Patients with viral and bacterial infections often have similar symptoms—congestion, cough, sore throat—making it difficult for physicians to differentiate between the two in the absence of a diagnostic test. In these cases, doctors may go ahead and prescribe antibiotics because they perceive the risk of not prescribing them as greater than that from unnecessary antibiotic use.
4. **Assuming that other doctors are the problem**. In some cases, even when doctors agree that antibiotic overuse is a major problem or know that the drugs are not appropriate for a specific condition, they may not think their individual practices, or those of peers in the same medical specialty, contribute significantly to the problem. Rather, studies show that physicians attribute inappropriate prescribing to other clinicians or blame other areas of medicine.

### Community and Hospital Acquired Infections [[ref 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9501977/), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414085/)]
- **Community**: COVID, Influenza virus, Strep. Pyogenes, Strep. Pneumoniae, Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, Rhinovirus, RSV.
- **Hospital (nosocomial)**: COVID, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Legionella, MRSA, Strep. Pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae.

## Non-clinical Factors

### Insurance Coverage:

- **Premium Costs:** Lower SES often correlates with reduced ability to afford health insurance premiums, leading to gaps in coverage or choosing plans with high deductibles and minimal benefits.
- **Employer-Sponsored Insurance:** People with higher SES are more likely to have jobs that offer comprehensive health insurance as a benefit. Those in lower-paying jobs or in sectors without benefits often don't have this access.
- **Public Assistance:** While Medicaid provides health insurance for many low-income individuals and families, eligibility varies by state. Some individuals may fall into a "coverage gap," earning too much for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance.
- **Knowledge and Navigation:** Lower SES may correlate with reduced health literacy, making it more challenging for individuals to navigate complex health insurance systems, understand their benefits, or select the best insurance plans for their needs.

### ED

- **Primary Care Access:** Individuals with lower SES might not have regular access to primary care providers due to a lack of insurance or inability to afford out-of-pocket costs. Without primary care, these individuals may delay seeking care until conditions worsen and then turn to the emergency department (ED) for relief.
- **Perceived Barriers:** Some people with low SES may perceive more barriers to accessing routine healthcare, such as transportation issues, inability to take time off work, or concerns about costs. This can lead to increased reliance on EDs.
- **After-Hours Care:** For those without flexible work hours or access to primary care, the ED might be the only available option for medical issues that arise outside of regular business hours.
- **Chronic Conditions:** Lower SES is linked to higher rates of certain chronic conditions, which can result in more frequent ED visits if not managed effectively in outpatient settings.
- **Health Literacy:** A lack of health literacy can lead to difficulty in discerning when it's appropriate to visit an ED versus other healthcare settings. Individuals might not recognize early symptoms of serious conditions, leading to ED visits when conditions become acute, or they might use the ED for issues that could be addressed in less acute settings.
- **ED as a "Safety Net":** For many uninsured or underinsured individuals, the ED serves as a safety net because federal law mandates that emergency departments provide care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay.

### Respiratory Distress

* **Breathing rate**. An increase in the number of breaths per minute may mean that a person is having trouble breathing or not getting enough oxygen.
* **Color change**s. A bluish color seen around the mouth, on the inside of the lips, or on the fingernails may happen when a person is not getting as much oxygen as needed. The color of the skin may also appear pale or gray.
* **Grunting**. A grunting sound can be heard each time the person exhales. This grunting is the body's way of trying to keep air in the lungs so they will stay open.
* **Nose flaring.** The openings of the nose spreading open while breathing may mean that a person is having to work harder to breathe.
* **Retractions**. The chest appears to sink in just below the neck or under the breastbone with each breath or both. This is one way of trying to bring more air into the lungs, and can also be seen under the rib cage or even in the muscles between the ribs.
* **Sweating**. There may be increased sweat on the head, but the skin does not feel warm to the touch. More often, the skin may feel cool or clammy. This may happen when the breathing rate is very fast.
* **Wheezing**. A tight, whistling or musical sound heard with each breath can mean that the air passages may be smaller (tighter), making it harder to breathe.
* **Body position**. A person may spontaneously lean forward while sitting to help take deeper breaths. This is a warning sign that he or she is about to collapse. 

### Deep nasal suction
Nasopharyngeal (through the nose) and oropharyngeal (through the mouth) suctioning are done to clear secretions (mucus) from the throat if a child is unable to cough them up or swallow them. A hard-plastic tip with a handle called a Yankauer is usually used to suction secretions in the mouth.

### Counseling
1. **Improved Health Outcomes**:
   - **Emotional Health**: Counseling can help patients cope with and manage emotional challenges, such as anxiety, depression, or stress, which can be associated with or exacerbated by medical conditions.
   - **Behavior Change**: Through counseling, patients can gain insights and motivation to make positive behavior changes, such as quitting smoking, losing weight, or adhering to a medication regimen.
   - **Disease Management**: Counseling can empower patients with chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension to understand and manage their diseases better, leading to improved clinical outcomes.
2. **Enhanced Patient Satisfaction**:
   - **Patient-Centered Care**: Counseling often adopts a patient-centered approach, ensuring that care is tailored to the individual's unique needs, preferences, and values.
   - **Empathy and Validation**: Counseling provides an avenue for patients to feel heard, understood, and validated, leading to increased satisfaction with their care.
   - **Improved Doctor-Patient Relationship**: Counseling fosters open communication, trust, and rapport between the patient and the healthcare provider.
3. **Increased Adherence**:
   - **Understanding Barriers**: Counseling can help identify and address barriers to adherence, whether they're logistical (e.g., difficulty getting medications), cognitive (e.g., misunderstandings about the treatment), or emotional (e.g., fear of side effects).
   - **Education**: Counseling often involves educating patients about their condition and the importance of adherence to treatment. Understanding the "why" behind a treatment can improve adherence.
   - **Self-Efficacy**: Counseling can boost patients' confidence in their ability to manage their health, which in turn can increase their likelihood of following through with treatment recommendations.
