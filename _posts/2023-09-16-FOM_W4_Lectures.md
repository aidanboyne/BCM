# Monday Notes

### Testing
 - Coronary: ischemia --> acute MI
 - Muscle: squeeze --> BP
 - Rhythm: palpitations --> syncope
 - Aortic disease --> BP
 - Valves, congenital, pericardial

Testing via labs, rhythm, imaging, cath, and functional tests. These may be invasive or non-invasive. We want to improve symptoms or outcomes. 

Younger patients usually lower risk for MI, check for prior symptoms and family hx. Usually EKG/Echo sufficient. Middle age patients (50s) is prime time for acute MI and you want to check for comorbidities - EKG/labs/CXR, Echo/MRI, and possible cath is indicated. Older patients can have multifactorial heart issues including clotting and fibrillations. Want lots of tests and look for PE.

- `CO = HR x SV`
- `MAP - CVP = CO x SVR`

Three layers of vessels:
 - Intima: endothelial
 - Media: smooth muscle (vast majority of resistance, modulate BP)
 - Adventitia: connective tissue and vaso vasorum

Arteries: away from heart, low compliance, high pressure
Veins: towards heart, high compliance, low pressure. Have most of blood volume.

## Sympathetic Nervous

| **Organ/Action** | **Receptors** |
|---|---|
| Skeletal muscle and brain vessel dialation  | A1, B2 |
| Pupillary dilation and aq. humor production | A1, B2 |
| Decrease saliva | B2 |
| Increased HR and contractility | A1, B1 |
| Bronchodilation | B2 |
| Increased blood glucose from liver (glucagon-like response) | B2 |
| Vasoconstriction of blood vessels and decresed motility in GI | A1, B2 |
| Secretion of renin by kidneys to increase BP | B1 |
| Increase sweat production | Muscarinic |
| Increase bladder urinary retention | A1 |
| Uterine relaxation and ejaculation | A1, B2 |

Sympathetic nervous system has preganglionic neurons that release acetylcholine binding nicotinic receptors on the postganglionic neuron. Postganglionic usually release catecholamines to bind target cell adrenergic receptors, though a few release acetylcholine binding muscarinic receptors on target cells.

- Alpha-1: vasoconstriction of blood vessels, mydriasis, urinary retention, and ejaculation
- Alpha-2: norepinephrine binds with negative feedback loop (decrease sympathetic action)
- Beta-1: increased HR and contractility, renin release increasing Na+ and water retention
- Beta-2: SM dilation in brain, muscle, bronchodilation, down GI activity, secrete aq. humor, increase glucose production in liver and cause glucagon release in pancreas.

## Parasympathetic
Arises from CN III, VII, IX, and X along with pelvic splanchnic nerves S2-S4. Vagus nerve innervates many organs (esophagus, heart, lungs, liver, GI (transverse colon)).

| **Organ/Action** | **Receptor** |
|---|---|
| Eye: pupil constriction (miosis) | M3 |
| Salivary: increase secretion | M3 |
| Heart: Decreased HR and contractility | M2 |
| Lungs: Bronchoconstriction | M3 |
| GI: Increased blood flow and motility | M1-3 |
| Liver: Increase glucose storage, insulin release | M1, M3 |
| Bladder: Decreased urinary retention (decrease contraction) | M3 |
| Uterus/Penis: Increase contractions, erections | M1, M4-5 |

### Sympathetic Drugs

 - Direct agonists (alpha1, beta selective or nonselective)
 - Indirect agonists (mimic i.e. amphetamines/cocaine)
 - Mixed agonists
 - Presynaptic antagonists (central/peripheral)
 - Postsynaptic antagonists (alpha/beta blockers)

### Parasympathetic Drugs
 - Direct cholinomimetics 
 - Indirect cholinomimetics (anticholinesterases)
 - Muscarinic antagonists

These result in DUMB HAVES (**defecation**, **urination**, **muscle** excitation, **bronchospasm**, **HR** down, **autonomic** ganglia stimulation, **vasodilation**, **eye** miosis, and increased **secretions**)

**Organophosphate poisoning** cause parasympathetic overdrive. Treated with _atropine_ which counteracts the acetylcholine esterase inactivation of organophosphates by blocking muscarinic receptors that are being overstimulated by acetylcholine.

**Asthma** attack typically treated with beta-2 agonists. However, heart has some beta-2 receptors and high dose albuterol can activate beta-1 on heart and cause electrolyte abnormalities causing _arrhythmia_. **Beta-blockers** are first line treatment for arrhythmia, however, caution is needed in asthmatic patients as it may worsen attack via beta-2 inhibition --> bronchoconstriction.

## Cardiovascular Hemodynamics

### Shock

#### Delivered Oxygen
`DO2 = CO x CaO2`
- `CO = HR x SV`
  - Stroke volume is determined by preload, cardiac function, and afterload.
- `CaO2 = 1.34 x [Hb] x SpO2`

There are various types of shock, however they can overlap and occur due to related or independent problems.

#### Cardiogenic
Pump failure - lack of sufficient O2 delivery. Characterized by low BP, high HR, can present with arrhythmia and abnormal cardiac exam. 

#### Distributive
Vascular resistance is very low - low time for O2 extraction at tissue layer:
 - Septic shock: toxins cause vasodilation via NO and other vasodilator release. 
 - Anaphylactic: Exposure to allergen causes massive histamine release -->  massive vasodilation

#### Hypovolemic
Low circulating blood volume via loss of fluids (dehydration) or hemorrhage (**hemorrhagic shock**)

#### Obstructive
Something obstructs circulation. Can be internal physical block (i.e. PE) or some external block (i.e. cardiac tamponade).

**MVO2** (mixed venous oxygen saturation) signifies how much oxygen is being consumed by the tissues in systemic circulation.

|     Type of Shock    |     Features/Diagnosis (BP, MVO2,   temp)    |     Treatment Options    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Hypovolemic or hemorrhagic | - Decreased BP (hypotension) <br> - Decreased MVO2 (due to reduced cardiac output and tissue hypoxia) <br> - Normal or decreased temperature | - Fluid resuscitation (saline or blood products) <br> - Control of bleeding source <br> - Surgery if needed |
| Cardiogenic | - Decreased BP (hypotension) <br> - Narrow pulse pressure <br> - Decreased MVO2 (due to poor cardiac output) <br> - Cold, clammy skin | - Inotropic/chronotropic support (e.g. beta agonists such as dobutamine) <br> - Diuretics (e.g., furosemide) <br> - Vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerin) <br> - Mechanical support (e.g., intra-aortic balloon pump) |
| Obstructive | - Decreased BP (hypotension) <br> - Decreased or variable MVO2 (depending on the cause of obstruction) <br> - Normal or decreased temperature | - Relief of obstruction (e.g., pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade, thrombolysis or embolectomy for pulmonary embolism) <br> - Surgery if needed |
| Distributive (e.g., septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic) | - Decreased BP (hypotension) <br> - Increased MVO2 (due to shunting of blood away from hypoperfused tissues) <br> - Warm, flushed skin (except in neurogenic shock where skin can be warm or cold) | - Fluid resuscitation <br> - Vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) <br> - Treat underlying cause (e.g., antibiotics for sepsis, epinephrine for anaphylaxis, spinal stabilization for neurogenic shock) |

#### Coagulation modifying drugs

| **Type of Anticoagulant** |     **Mechanism of Action**    |
|---|---|
|     Heparin    |     Potentiation of antithrombin   III    |
|     Warfarin    |     Inhibits   vitamin K epoxide reductase    |
|     Rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban    |     Factor Xa inhibition    |
|     Dabigatran, bivalirudin    |     Direct thrombin (IIa)   inhibitor    |

# Tuesday Notes

## Vasopressors for distributive shock

* Sepsis: inflammatory response leads to vasodilation and capillary leak (hypotension and tachycardia)

* Anaphylaxis: large histamine release leads to vasodilation and capillary leak (hypotension and tachycardia)

* Neurogenic: Loss of sympathetic tone due to damaged autonomic pathways in spinal cord (hypotension and bradycardia)

# Wednesday Notes

## Renal Filtration

### Glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule

Filtration begins in **glomerulus** and **Bowman's Capsule**. The fenestrations in glomerular epithelium, negativley charged basement membrane, podocyte slit diaphragm all contribute to filtration of only small and neutral/uncharged solutes into Bowman's capsule. The GFR is directly proportional to blood pressure. Hypertension will increase GFR, hypotension (i.e. hemmorhage) will decrease GFR (and in bleed, sympathetic nervous system will constrict afferent arteriole further decreasing blood to nephrons).

### PCT

- Sodium is primarily reabsorbed via Na-H exchanger. 
- Bicarbonate is so small that it is filtered even though it is negativley charged and thus needs to be reabsorbed. HCO3 is broken down into H20 and CO2 via **carbonic anhydrase**, CO2 enters cell and is converted back into HCO3 in cell and transported via NaHCO3 cotransporter into the cell. 
  - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (**acetazolamide**) prevent HCO3- reabsorbtion, **increasing uring pH** and **decreasing blood pH**.
  - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also cause (weak) **diuresis** (increased urine), H+ ions not used in PCT by carbonic anhydrase, so Na+/H+ exchanger is not active and less Na+ is reabsorbed into blood --> less water reabsorbed into the blood. 
- Aquaporin-1 in PCT allows H20 to follow sodium into blood from PCT (_not hormonally regulated_)
- Glucose is reclaimed via Na-Glucose transporter (SGLT2) into cell and then into blood via GLUT2 (_not insulin dependent_). 
  - SGLT2 inhibitors (i.e. empagliflozin) block this glucose reabsorbtion, lowering blood sugar. Can cause recurrent UTIs
- Na+/K+ pumps 3Na+ out of cell into blood and 2K+ into cell. This maintains low Na+ gradient in cell.

### Descending loop of Henle

 - Aquaporin 1: _not hormonally regulated_ water uptake

### Thick ascending loop of Henle
 - Water **impermeable**
 - NaK2Cl cotransporter brings all three ions into the cell. Renal outer medually K+ (ROMK) channel lets K+ _back_ into tubule and Cl- channel lets Cl- into the blood
  - **Loop diuretics** block NaK2Cl cotransporter, reducing ion gradient in interstituium and thus reducing water reuptake and causing **diuresis**
  - Furisomide is loop diuretic used for fluid buildup - especially **pulmonary edema**
  - Strong diuretic target
 - Na+ gradient maintained again by Na+/K+ ATPase

### Distal convoluted tubule
 - Na+/Cl- cotransporter continues establishing gradient.
  - Inhibited by thiazides (weaker diuretic)

### Collecting Dructs
 - Aldosterone binds to intercellular mineralcorticoid receptors, increasing epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression and insertion into duct cell membrane. This brings Na+ into the blood and in return we must _excrete_ K+ and H+
  - Aldosterone produced in adrenal gland
  - Ademomas can cause very high levels of aldosterone --> high K+ in urine. This can cause generalized weakness (K+ required for muscle contraction)
 - ADH binds surface receptor (GPCRs) and causes expression of aquaporin-2 on collecting duct epithelium, bringing in water.
  - Low ADH can cause polyuria (high urine volume) and hypernatremia.

#### Other notes:
 - Glomerulus is _resistant_ to ischemia. **PCT** is very vunerable to damage from chronic hemmorhage.



# Reading Notes

# Osmosis Notes

## Shock

Whole body circulatory failure causing cellular and organ damage that can progress into multi-organ failure. We look at **blood pressure = resistance x cardiac output** (HR x SV). SV = ESV-EDV.

#### Types of Shock
- **Hypovolemic**: low fluid. Can be non-hemorrhagic or hemorrhagic (about 20% blood volume loss - 1L). This lowers EDV, lowering CO. This causes catecholmamines, ADH, and Angiotensin II.
  - Shock presents with _low_ MVO2 and cold skin.
- **Cardiogenic**: heart muscle damage reducing SV (i.e. MI or obstruction via pericarditis).
  - Also presents with _low_ MVO2 and cold skin.
- **Distributive**: leakyness of blood vessesls and arterial vasodialation reducing resistance. Usually result of sepsis via bacterial endotoxins (cause NO and complement --> histamine). Cytokines trigger PAF and ROS damaging cells increasing leakyness. Pro-coagulation causes further reduction in perfusion. 
  - Presents with _normal or high_ MVO2 and increased skin temperature.
  - Subtypesa include anaphylatic and neurogenic shock

## Hemostasis

![Hemostasis](/img/hemostasis.png)

#### Primary hemostasis. Five steps:
1. Endothelial injury: nerve causes vascular spasm to decrease blood flow. NO and prostaglandin secretion is lowered and endothelin is released, causing muscle contraction.
2. Exposure: collagen is exposed and binds to VWF from endothelial cells.
3. Adhesion: Platelets bind VWF via GP1b
4. Activation: Platelet activation causes shape change and VWf, serotonin, Ca2+, ADP, Thromboxane A2 secretion. Positive feedback activation limited to injury site by NO and prostaglandins. When ADP and thromboxane A2 bind platlet, they are fully activated via expression of GPIIb/IIIa 
5. Aggregation: GPIIb/IIIa binds fibrinogen and causes aggregation

#### Secondary hemostasis: coagulation
Proteolytic activation of clotting proteins that eventually activate fibrin (factor Ia)

Extrinsic Pathway: activated by tissue factor found outside blood
 - Tissue factor (Factor III) exposed by damage. Some active Factor VII (VIIa) binds tissue factor and Ca2+ forming VIIa-TF complex cleaving Factor X to Xa. This cleaves V to Va and forms prothombinase with Va, Xa, and Ca2_ to activate thrombin (IIa). Thrombin activates platelets, and factors V, VIII, IX. IX cleaves fibrinogen (I) to fibrin (Ia) which precipitates to form chains in blood. It also cleaves XIII into XIIIa which crosslinks fibrin chains with Ca2+ cofactor.

Intrinsic Pathway: all activating factors found in blood
 - XII encounters phosphates on platelets or subendothelial collagen --> XIIa. XIIa cleaves XI --> XIa + Ca2+ --> IX activation. IXa complexes with Ca2+ and VIIIa to cleave X into Xa. VIII normally degrades in blood if not bound to VWF.

 Coagulation tested via:
  - Prothombin time (PT): extrinsic pathway
  - Activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT): intrinsic pathway

> There are 12 coagulation factors (I - XIII, no VI)
{: .prompt-tip }

![Coagulation cascade](/img/clotting.png)


## Clot retraction and fibrinolysis

Occurs after primary and secondary hemostasis. Anticoagulation occurs during and after and prevents overgrowth of clot and embolism. Thrombin is the big player in coagulation (activates V, VIII, I, and XIII) so it is targeted by 2 proteins to control:
 - Protein C: circulating plasma protein produced in liver with cofactor protein S (forms thrombomodulin). CS binds excess thrombin. This inactivates V (stopping X in common) and VIII (stopping IX in intrinsic).
 - Antithrombin III: made by liver and binds thrombin and X. Also inhibits VII, IX, XI and XII at low level. Heparin binds antithrombin to increase inhibition of VII, IX, XI and XII.

NO and prostacyclin lower thromboxane A2 in platelets (lowers GPIIb/IIIa).

Clot retraction is mediated by lamellipodia made of actin and begins around day 1. These lamellipodia increase surface area to bind fibrin mesh and blood vessel. Clot platlets have integrin alphaIIB-beta3 which binds fibrin and activates myosin to contract lamellipodia and pull ends of injury together. 

Around day 2 fibrinolysis causes gradual degradation of fibrin mesh. Plasminogen is converted by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) released by endothelial cells in high amounts when exposed to factor X and thrombin. This causes formation of plasmin. Process is regulated by endothelial release of plasminogen activator inhibitor and antiplasmin from endothelial cells. Plasmin proteolytically cuts fibrin chains. Plasmin also activated by protein C, Xa, XIIa, and kallikrein. tPA is "Clot buster drug" in clinical use. 

### Vitamin K
Factors II, VII, IX, and X require vitamin K dependent enzyme for synthesis. It is fat soluble and stored in adipocytes, found in leafy greens, and made by gut microbes. Vitamine K is mobilized in dietary form (Vitamin K Quinone) and reduced to Vitamin K Hydoquinone which acts as cofactor in gamma-glutamyl carboxylase which carboxylates (activates) II, VII, IX, and X on glutamic acid residues. This results in vitamin K epoxide which is converted back to vitamin K Quinone by **exposide reductase** which is blocked by the blood thinner Warfarin. 

## Myocardial Infarction

Necrosis of cardiomyocytes due to ischemia of coronary arteries. Almost always a result of endothelial cell damage in coronary vessels (tunica intima). Plaques are a mix of fat, cholesterol, proteins, calcium, and WBC which are highly thrombogenic and can cause thrombotic occlusion when the cap of the plaque is damaged.

#### Common sites of MI
 - Left anterior descending (LAD): anterior wall and septum of LV
 - Right coronary artery (RCA): posterior wall, septum, and papillary muscles of LV
 - Left circumflex artery (LCX): lateral wall of LV 

Within 1 minute, ischemic damage occurs and contractility is lost. within 20-40 minutes, damage is irreversible. Damage usually occurs most on the inner third of myocardium. If clot lyses, they can have damage limited to this region - **Subendocardial infarct** or **NSTEMI** - which presents with ST segment depression (no elevation). Other causes of NSTEMI include severe atherosclerosis and hypotension.

Within 3-6 hours, the entire myocardial wall is necrosed. This presents with ST elevation and is called a **transmural infarct** or **STEMI**.

#### Symptoms
 - Chest pain/pressure radiates to L arm or jaw
 - Diaphoresis
 - Nausea
 - Fatigue
 - Dyspnea

Labs can pick up troponin I, troponin T (both appear within 2-4 hr and peak around 48, stay for 7-10 days), and CK-MB (appear within 2-4 hr and peak at 24, gone by 28). CK-MB is good for detecting second infarct.

Complications include:
 - 0-24 hr: arrythmias, cardiogenic shock
 - 1-3 d: pericarditis
 - 3-14 d: myocardial rupture of granulation tissue
 - 14+ d: scarring can cause heart failure

#### Therapy
 - Fibrinolytics
 - Angioplasty
 - Percutaneous coronary intervention (stents)
 - Other meds (antiplatlets, anticoagulants, nitrates, beta blockers, pain meds, and statins)

These can cause reperfusion injury due to Ca2+ mediated contraction and ROS generation from oxygen. 

## Syncope

Loss of consciousness and muscle strength due to low blood flow to the brain. Presyncope is characterized by muscle weakness, blurred vision, and feeling faint.

Neurocardiogenic, vasovagal, and reflex syncope are the most common. Benign triggered by parasympathetic activation followed by vagus nerve discharge. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity can trigger syncope with tight collar or turning head.

Prodrome is period of symptoms before losing conciousness. Dizziness, warmth/coldness, odd sensations are common. Usually present with normal physical and ECG.

Orthostatic hypotension is **drop > 20mmHg systolic or > 10mmHg diastolic** or **reflex tachycardia > 20bpm** when standing abruptly. Caused by reduced CO and is often due to dehydration. Lower vein constriction is delayed leading to blood pooling in legs (decreased venous return). Elders, pregnant women. Can also be caused by drugs:
- Vasoconstriction blockers: Ca2+ blockers, beta blockers, alpha blockers, nitrates,
- Diuretics
- QT prolonging drugs: antipsychotics, and antiemetics can cause.

Psychiatric conditions (anxiety, panic) can cause syncope. Metabolic (hypoglycemia and hypoxia) and drug/alcohol abuse can also cause syncope. 

> Decreased venous --> ventricular hypercontractility due to exaggerated sympathetic activation --> sympathetic withdrawal --> parasympathetic overdrive --> bradycardia, peripheral vasodilation, failure of reflex cerebral dilation --> vasovagal syncope.

**Cardiac Syncope** is life threatening and can be caused by _arythmia_, ischemia, and valvular abnormalities like aortic stenosis, cardiac tamponade, and pacemaker malfunction. 

**PE** can result in syncope due to hypoxia. Severe hemorrhage, trauma, GI bleeding, ruptured aortic aneurysm, ruptured spleen, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are other systemic causes.

Syncope needs to be distinguished from seizure, stroke, sleep disturbances, and head injury. Number, frequency, and duration along with prodrome are important factors. Syncope without prodrome suggests arythmia. As about potential triggers and changes in position. Look for injuries if patient fell and check ECG for arythmia or MI. Holter monitor can record day and night to ID arythmias. Tilt table test can determine orthostatic hypotension.

Management depends on cause but it is often unexplained. High risk patients with cardiac symptoms should be admitted for management and cardiac monitoring.

## Blood Pressure

Blood flow (Q) = volume/time. Velocity (v) = distance/sec. CVP = central venous pressure. CVP often ignored in calculations.
 - `Q = A x v = CO`. 
 - `MAP (aortic) - CVP = P_i - P_f = Q x R`

Pressure highest in large arteries. Systolic (ventricles contracting, 1/3 of sycle) pressure and diastolic (ventricles relaxed, 2/3 of cycle).
 - `MAP = 1/3(SBP)+2/3(DBP) = DBP + 1/3(Pulse Pressure)`

## Sympathetic Nervous System
Part of autonomic peripheral nervous system. Maximizes blood flow to muscles and brain "fight or flight" response.

Autonomic nervous system is made of relay including 2 neurons. Group of neuron cell bodies in CNS = nucleus, outside is called ganglion. Sympathetic nervous system axons originate in the hypothalamus and synapse with spinal cord nuclei starting at T1 and running down to L2. This short preganglionic fiber has a short axon that synapses with the post-ganglionic cell body in the sympathetic chain (para-vertebral) or in one of the pre-vertebral ganglia.
 - **Celiac Ganglia**: wall of aorta
 - **Superior Mesenteric Ganglia**: near superior mesenteric artery
 - **Inferior Mesenteric Ganglia**: near inferior mesenteric artery

The postganglionic nerves then synapse with target organs. The preganglionic neuron releases **acetyl choline** and bind ot **nicotinic receptor** (cholinergic) on postganglionic neuron. Most postganglionic neurons are adrenergic and release chatecolamines (noradrenaline) which interact with cells of target organs. However, some postganglionic neurons are also cholinergeic and release acetylcholine to act on cellular muscarinic receptors. 

Sympathetic acts on
 - alpha 1/2 of blood vessels in gastrointestinal tract (vasoconstriction)
 - beta 2 of blood vesselsin muscle and brain (vasodilation)
 - alpha 1 and beta 1 in heart increasing HR and contractility
 - beta 2 in lungs (bronchodilation), salivary glands (down saliva), liver (up gluconeogenesis)
 - alpha 1/2, beta 3 in bladder (detrusor activation)
 - muscarinic receptors in the skin to increase sweating
 - beta 1/2 in uterus for uterine relaxation
 - alpha 1 in penis for ejaculation

Everything here is also controlled by the parasympatetic with opposite effects _except_ the **blood vessels** and **sweat glands** which are controlled _only_ by the sympathetic in an on off manner. Sympathetic has low basal activation that rises in extreme situations.

## Parasympathetic Nervous System
Slows HR, lowers BP, and stimulates digestion.

Hypothalamic parasympatetic neurons synapse with brainstem nuclei (CNIII, VII, IX, and X) or with nuclei in S2-S4. They travel through preganglionic and synapse with postganglionic in parasympatetic ganglia.

Vagus nerve (CNX) and nerves originating from S2-S4 (pelvic splanchnic nerves) have parasympathetic ganglia all the way in target organs.
 - Vagus synapses with ganglia in esophagus, heart, lungs, liver, and GI up to transverse colon
 - Pelvic synapses with ganglia in reproductive organs and bladder

CNIII (occulomotor), VII (facial), and IX (glossopharyngeal) synapse in cranial ganglia: 

![III, VII, and IX ganglia](/img/parasympth_cranial_ganglia.png)

Preganglionic and postganglionic are both cholinergic and release acetylcholine. Preganglionic acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptors in postganglionic body while postganglionic acetylcholine binds muscarinic receptors in target cells. 
 - Increase GI motility
 - Increase urination
 - Decrease HR and CO
 - Increases glucose storage
 - Increases saliva
 - Causes miosis (close vision)
 - Causes erection and female genital secretions

# Anatomy

### Lungs
Separated by mediastinum which contains heart, thoracic great vessels, trachea, and esophagus, and the thymus. They have three surfaces (mediastinal, costal, and diaphragmatic) and borders (anterior, inferior, and posterior). Right is larger and heaver but shorter and wider with 3 lobes. Left is smaller and has superior and inferior lobe.

### Tracheobroncial Tree

Trachea with c-shaped hyaline cartilage rings. Divides into main bronchi at sternal angle. Right is wider, shorter, and more verticle. Bronchi divide into secondary lobar bronchi (one for each lobe). The tertiary segments supply the 10 right lung segments and 8-10 left lung segments. Each tertiary segment branches 20-25 more times until they reach terminal bronchioles --> respiratory bronchioles --> aveolar ducts --> aveolar sacs --> aveoli.

Functional circulation (pulmonary arteries and veins) re-oxegenate blood and allow CO2 removal. Arteries arise at level of sternal angle and divide into pairs of secondary lobar arteries (one for each lobe). One superior and pulmonary vein for each lung. 

Nutritive circulation include right (one) and left (two) bronchial arteries and supply down to respiratory bronchiole level. L/R bronchial veins only drain areas near hilar root and esophogeal veins. Rest goes to pulmonary veins (small amount of deoxygenated blood).

Innervated by pulmonary plexus. Parasympatetic are presynaptic vagus nerve fibers (bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, and secretion). Sympathetic are postsynaptic fibers from paravertebral ganglia of sympathetic trunks (bronchodialation, vasoconstriction, and stop of constriction). Visceral afferent fibers are reflexive or nocioceptive and carry signals for reflex (cough) and pain respectivley. Pleural nerves derive from intercostal and phrenic nerves.

### Pleural Cavity and Lungs
 - Always penetrate directly above rib. Intercostal nerve runs along inferior border of rib bones, so if you penetrate directly below rib, you have risk of severing or injuring the nerve.
 - The superior tip of the pleural cavity reaches _above_ the clavicle. Keep this in mind when performing procedures in the region to avoid pneumothroax. Inferior tip lies posterior and lateral to the liver covered by the diaphragm and is known as costal-diaphragmatic recess. Watch for this when doing liver biopsy - again can cause pneumothorax if you penetrate parietal pleura.
  - Left lung has 2 lobes (superior and inferior) separated by oblique fissure. Right has 3 lobes (superior, middle, inferior). Superior and inferior separated by oblique fissure. Superior and middle separated by horizontal fissure. Lungs covered by visceral pleura. Top is apex bottom is base. Rib markings indicate lung overexpansion, usually due to difficulty getting air out of lung (exhalation mostly passive process).
  - Hilum has inferior and anterior openings for pulmonary veins (usually 4). Right lung has big central opening with thick walled structure posterior to that (pulmonary artery and bronchus respectivley). It also has superior vena cava and ascus vein impressions in superior section. Left has medial airway and superior pulmonary artery and cardiac experssion and lingula of superior lobe. Both have pulmonary ligaments inferior to hilum. Black dots in hilum are lymph nodes which have collected carbon particles. 

#### Pleura
Visceral pleura adheres to lung and parietal (thicker) lines the pulmonary cavity. Cavity is filled with thin layer of film. Pleaura are continuous at hilum of lung. 

Parietal has costal, cervial (forms pleural cupula and is strengthened by suprapleural membrane), mediastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura. These create lines (sternal, costal, and vertebral) of pleural reflection which indicate boundaries of pleural cavity. 

#### Intercostal nerves and vessels
Neurovascular structure contains vein, artery, and nerve inferior to rib bone in this order (superior to inferior). 12 pairs of thoracic spinal nerves divide into anterior rami and posterior rami. T1-11 anterior rami form intercostal nerves while T12 anterior rami forms subcostal nerve. Give anterior/lateral branches for throacic/abdominal wall, musclular branches for thoracic wall muscles, and comminicating branches to connect to sympathetic trunk.

Typical nerves T3-6 past between innermost intercostal and internal intercostal muscles. T1-2 (run on internal rib surface) and T7-11 (become thoracoabdominal nerves) are atypical. T4 gives nipple sensation and T10 gives umbilical sensation.

![arteries](/img/intercostal_arteries.PNG)

Intercostal spaces 3-11 are supplied by thoracic aorta and supply spinal cord, vertebral column, and dorsal muscles and skin. They anastamose with anterior intercostal arteries (from interior thoracic artery) in the upper 9 intercostal spaces.

# Pharmacology

## Sympathomimetics
Mimic action of norepinepherine (neurotransmitter) or epinepherine (hormone).

Adrenergic Receptors (GPCRs)
 - Alpha 1: **Gq** activates smooth muscle via Ca2+ from IP3/DAG. Increases MAP via arteriolar and venous vasoconstriction and increased venous return. Dialates pupils, constricts muscles in genitourinary tract. 
 - Alpha 2: **Gi** sympatholytics which decrease sympathetic tone via decreased cAMP. Presynaptic neurotransmitter inhibition. Decreases insulin release and lypolysis, and aqueous humor produciton.
 - Beta 1: **Gs** found on cardiac myocytes including SA and AV nodes. Increases HR and contractility --> increased CO. Increases renin release (maintain blood volume).
 - Beta 2: **Gs** activates PKA causing relaxation of smooth muscle. Bronchodialation, skeletal and cardiac muscle vasodialation via decreased SVR (drop in diastolic pressure). Increases lypolysis, gluconeogenesis, insulin release, and potassium uptake into cells. Increases aqueous humor production. 

### Drugs
 - **Phenylephrine**: alpha-1 agonist. Smooth muscle activation, nasal decongestant, pupillary dilator. Increase SVR and MAP. Used in hypovolemia and distributed shock to boost MAP. Reflex bradychardia. 
 - **Norepinephrine**: alpha-1/2 agonist. Minor beta 1 activity. Increase SVR, MAP. Reflex bradycardia. Increased SV and CO and pulse pressure. Used in septic shock.
 -  **Dobutamine**: mostly beta-1. Increased HR, contractility, and CO. Treats refractory heart failure. Minimal decrease in SVR but still increased pulse pressure. Used in cardiogenic shock and in cardiac stress test.
 - **Isoproteronol**: Beta-1/2 agonist. Increased HR, contractility, vasodilation. Decreased SVR and diastolic. MAP decrease and increased pulse pressure. 
 - **Terbutaline and ritodrine**: Beta-2 uterine relaxers
 - **Albuterol, formoterol, salmeterol**: Beta-2 bronchodialators
 - **Epinephrine**: dose dependent general agonist
  - At **low doses** beta dominant: Beta 2 bronchodialation. Drops diastolic pressure and decreases SVR. Beta 1 increased HR and contractility.
  - At **high doses** alpha dominant: vasoconstrition, increased SVR and BP. Increased pulse pressure.
  - Used for anaphylatic shock

## Cholinomimetics

Mimic actio of acetylcholine on nicotinic (autonomic ganglia, NMJ, adrenal gland) and muscarinic (SM of heart and glands, include M1, M2, and M3) receptors. Nicotinic receptors act as ion channels. M1 is Gq, M2 is Gi, and M3 is Gq coupled. M1 is in CNS and enteric nervous system. M2 is found in heart at atria, SA, and AV (not at ventricles). M3 is found on smooth muscles of various glands and the bladder and eye and can cause vasodilation when injected via NO release _or_ vasoconstriction if there is vascular damage.

### Drugs
 - Bethanechol: Muscarinic agonist. Increases secretory and motor activity of the gut (good for non-obstructive illeus and non-obstructive urinary retention)
 - Pilocarpine: Muscarinic agonist. Increases salivation, reduces intraocular pressure via ciliary muscle contraction (good for glaucoma), and cases pupillary constriction (helps acute angle glaucoma).
 - Carbachol: Muscarinic and nicotinic agonist. Pupillary constriction.
 - Methacholine: Nonspecific agonist. Instigates asthma via bronchial constriction. 
 - Verenicline: Nicotinic partial agonist used for smoking cessation.

Watch for COPD/asthma worsening, peptic ulcer aggrevation with all cholinomimetics.

## Antimuscarinics

Reversibly block muscarinic receptors. Block diarrhea, urination, miossis, bronchospasm, bradycardia, lacrimation, and salivation (DUMBBLS). Can cross blood-brain barrier and inhibit central M1.

 - Atropine: mydriasis (pupillary dilation), and ciliary weakness. Block M2 activation on SA and AV increasing HR and AV conduction, helping treat bradycardia and AV conduction blocks. 
 - Scopolamine: motion sickness treatment (usually transdermal) via vestibular center inhibition
 - Ipatropium and tiotropium: M3 muscarinic antagonists used for bronchodialators for COPD. Tiotropium has longer action
 - Oxybutynin and Tolterodine: M3 antagonists used for urinary incontinence via SM relaxation in ureters and bladder wall. 
 - Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl: Central M1 inhibitors used for reduction of tremor and rigidity in Parkinson's. Also treat extrapyramidal syndromes caused by antipsychotics. 

Toxicity can include increased HR, decreased sweating (hyperthermia), reduced salivation and lacrimation (dry mouth and eyes), blurred vission, severe eye pain due to decreased aqueous outflow and acute angle closure, sedation/agitation/hallucination/coma esp. in elderly patients.

## Alpha Drugs

#### Agonists

- Clonidine: alpha-2 agonist which inhibits sympathetic tone --> reduces blood pressure. Sympatholytic which treats hypertension. Useful in urgent hypersension and ADHD, Tourette's
- Alpha-methyldopa: alpha-2 agonist analog of L-DOPA acting to lower blood pressure. Primarily used in gestational hypertension. Can cause lupus-like syndrome. 
- Tizanidine: alpha-2 agonist, centrally acting muscle relaxant.

#### Antagonists

**Non-specific**
- Phentolamine: reversible alpha-1/2 antagonist. Cause vasodilation. Treat cocaine toxicity and MOA-B toxicity hypertensive crisis. Used pre-op in pheochromocytoma to block catecholamine excess induced hypertension, palpitation, and sweating.
- Phenoxybenzamine: irreversible alpha-1/2 antagonist.

Can cause orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachacardia

**Alpha-1 specific:** Praxosin (also treat PTSD side effects), terazosin, doxazosin, and tamulosin. Relax urinary smooth muscle to treat BPH pain. Cause vasodilation. Can cause orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachacardia

**Atypical**

Mirtaxapine: antagonism of alpha-2. Enhances norepinephrine and seratonin. Used to treat depression.

## Beta Blockers

End with "-lol" suffix. Include non-selective, selective, alpha/beta mixed.

Useful in managment of chronic stable angina by lowering myocardial oxygen demand and in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by slowing heart and increasing diastolic filling time. Can be used in prophylaxis for migranes (meteprolol, temolol, propanolol) and for treatment of thyroid storm syndromes/Grave's syndrome (propanolol, propothialol, along with predisolone). First line treatment of essential tremor and as a type II antiarrhythmic. 

Glucagon treats beta blocker toxicity via stimulation of the heart through non-beta receptors.

#### Beta-1 selective (A-BEAM)
Cardioselective. Good for acute MI by reducing O2 demand and increasing diastolic filling time. Used in long term chronic heart failure management - decreased mortality via reduced cardiac remodeling. Can be used in hypertensive management, mostly post MI or in heart failure. Inhibit beta blockers by antagonizing receptors at JGA.
 - Atenolol
 - Betaxolol
 - Esmolol: IV useful in aortic dissection
 - Acebutolol: some partial agonist activity - contraindicated with heart failure or MI history
 - Metoprolol

 Decrease cardiac contractility via beta-1 antagonism and supress SA/AV conduction which can cause bradycardia and arrythmia via AV blocks. 

#### Nonselective
  - Carvedolol: nonselective and alpha-1 blocker used in chronic heart failure. 
  - Labetalol: nonselective and alpha-1 blocker. Vasodilation and used for hypertension in pregnancy (preserves umbilical blood flow). Used IV in hypertensive emergency and in aortic dissection (along with propanolol).

Can treat glaucoma (timolol) via aqueous humor supression on ciliary epitheleum. Beta 2 blocking can worsen asthma or COPD via constriction, and are contraindicated. It can also cause impotence in men. 

#### Partial agonist
Acebutolol and pindolol. Contraindicated with heart failure or MI history

## Cardiovascular Development (Embryology)
Heart derives from visceral mesoderm. Part of the cranial mesoterm is a horseshoe-shaped area called primary heart field. Endoderm VEGF secretion causes heart tube formation on each side with lateral primitive pericardial cavity and is perfused via vitelline vein and blood leaves via superior end dorsal aorta. Lateral folding causes fusion of heart tubes to form primitive heart tube and veins fuse to sinus venosus. Aortic sac forms via dorsal aorte fusion and pericardial cavity forms. The heart tudbe includes internal endothelial lining and outer cardiac myoblast. Craniocaudal folding causes heart tube migration to thorax (by week 4) and development of sections (sinus venosus, primitive atrium - LR atria, and ventricle - LV, bulbus cordis - RV, and truncus arteriosis). Looping causes sectional movement and wall thickening.

Atrioventricular canal is eventually separated via endocardial cusions which fuse to separate R/L atrioventricular canal. Endocardial cells form tricuspid and mitral valves and septum primum slowly closes ostium primum until it fuses with endocardial cushion to separate atria while ostium secundum and septum secundum form foramen ovale to allow bloo flow in fetal development. A muscular ridge then divides ventricles. 


Truncus arteriosus is separated into aorta and pulmonary artery with valvular development to follow. Aortic arches are present from weeks 4-6 and are numbered 1-6.

1. Maxillary artery
2. Stapedial artery
3. Common carotids
4. L --> aortic arch, R --> right subclavian
5. Nothing (regresses)
6. Pulmonary arteries and L --> ductus arteriosus to bypass immature lungs

Meanwhile, the sinus venosus shifts to right atria and the right horn forms opening of superior and inferior vena cava, while the left horn becomes coronary sinus and oblique horn of LA. 

SA and then AV nodes differentiate and bundle of his/purkinje then form.

### Fetal blood flow

Adaptations and post-birth structures are:
1. Umbilical veins (O2) and arteries (no O2). Become _ligamentum venosum_ and _superior vesical arteries_ respectivley. 
2. Ductus venosus: bypasses hepatic circulation. Becomes _ligamentum venosum_.
3. Foramen ovale: opening that shunts blood from high pressure RA to low pressure LA, mostly bypassing RV and fetal lungs. Becomes _fossa ovalis_.
4. Ductus arteriosus: connects pulmonary artery and aorta. Shunts high pressure pulmonary circulation to aorta. Becomes _ligamentum arteriosum_.

Aorta splits into illiac arteries whose internal arteries form umbilical arteries. At birth RA pressure drops intensly as hypoxic vasoconstriction of pulmonary arteries goes away. Ductus arteriosis should close. Wharton's jelly constricts umbilical arteries and vein. 

#### Ventricular septal defect (VSD)

Ventricular wall has gap after fetal development due to failure of endocardial cushion and musclar ridge joining at membranous region. Most common congenital heart defect and 30-50% close spontaneously. Associated with **fetal alcohol syndrome** and **Down syndrome**.

VSD results in LV shunting to RV leading to higher O2 sat in RV, pulmonary circulation and presents with holosystolic murmur. Larger VSD can present with pulmonary hypertension and potential Eisenmenger syndrome (RV-->LV if pressure differential reverses leading to cyanosis).

#### Atrial septal defect (ASD)

Usually result of failure of foramen ovale closure via septum secundum and septum primum fusion. Mostly due to ostium secundum undergrowth. A few can be causes by hypoplasia of inferior ostium primum. 

This is an acyanotic heart defect presenting with RA, RV, and pulmonary O2 sat with S2 splitting and potential systolic murmur. The opening also allows embolism (i.e. from DVT) migration to systemic circulation --> stroke via _paradoxical embolism_.
