# Dianosis 

## Emergent Causes: 4+2+2
- **Cardiac**: Acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, tamponade, takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome)
- **Pulmonary**: Pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax
- **Esophageal**: Rupture, impaction

Once we rule these out, we can move on to anotomic causes:

### Anatomic causes

#### MSK
- Costrochondritis
- Rib fracture
- Strain
- Infection, cancer

#### Skin
- Herpes Zoster

#### Nervous
- Thoracic radiculopathy
- Anxiety

#### GI
- Spasm
- GI reflux
- Ulcer
- Biliary

#### Cardiac
- Heart Failure
- Aortic stenosis

#### Pulmonary 
- Pneumonia
- Pleuritis

#### Mediastinum
- Fat necrosis

## HPI

Look out for the following:
- Eating steak... --> impaction
- Right side --> lungs
- Lightning shock --> not typical of any life threatening problems
- Just pressure --> MI
- Hurts to breath, lie down --> pleuritic or pericarditis
- Straight to back --> aortic dissection
- Every time I go upstairs --> stable angina
- Right leg swollen --> PE

Really try not to put words in pt. mouth. Not multiple choice question.

### Cardiovascular ROS
- Chest discomfort
- Exertional capacity and symptoms
- Palpitations
- SOB
    - on exertion
    - paroxsymal nocturnal dyspnea
    - orthopnea
- Lightheadedness
- Fainting
- Swellin (weight gain)

### Peripheral vascular
- Pain/cramping in leg
- ulcers on feet
- changes in skin, hair, sensations, temp
- extremity swelling
- pain after eating

![Cardio Exam](/img/cardio_exam.png)

Pulses:
- absent
- 1+ weak
- 2+ normal
- 3+ bounding

Jugulars: give idea of RAP which approximates CVP
1. Find jugulars: venous pulsations or distension
2. Find height about sternal angle (about 10 cm above RA)
3. Add 10 and report JVP as one number (cm water)

Arterial is monophasic with prominent outward movement, palpable. Venous is biphasic with prominent inward movement, not palpable. If you can't see anything, obstruct the EJA or make them lie flat and observe.

### Murmurs

* Grade (out of 6)
    - (1/6) soft, medium, loud, thrill, thrill + audible with 1/2 lifted, audible (6/6)
* Occurrence (systolic vs diastolic, early vs. late etc)
    - Systolic after S1 (lubshhh-dub), diastolic after S2 (lub-dubshhh)
* Description/character:sound quality, pitch, shape, extra sounds
    - Harsh, soft musical, rumbling, high pitch (diaphragm) or low pitch (bell)
    - Holosystolic (same throughout), crescendo-decresendo, decresendo, decresendo-crescendo
* Area Where heard, or heard loudest
* Radiation e.g. to carotid, axilla, etc
    - Aortic stenosis/sclerosis → neck, clavicle, throughout precordium
    - Mitral regurgitation → axilla
* Maneuvers: how intensity changes with… increased preload or increased afterload

Occurence + location key for valve lesions:
- If open, murmur occurs when stenosed
- If closed, murmur occurs when regurgitating

#### Common murmurs
All day every day:
- Flow murmurs (quiet, over pulmonic, crescendo-decrescendo)

Common:
- Aortic stenosis/sclerosis
- Mitral regurgitation
- Tricuspid regurgitation

Less common, but important:
- Aortic regurgitation (e.g. from endocarditis)
- Mitral stenosis (caused by rheumatic fever)

Non-valvular murmurs: VSD, hypertrophic obstrutive cardiomyopathy, PDA

#### S3 & S4
- S3 gallop due to early diastolic filling into dilated (vol overloaded) LV or RV (**hear will bell**)
- S4 gallop from atrial kick pumping into stiff (pressure overloaded) LV or RV

#### Pericardial
- Rubs and knocks
    - Acute pericarditis: acute friction rub
    - Pericardial knock with constrictive pericarditis (similar to S3)
