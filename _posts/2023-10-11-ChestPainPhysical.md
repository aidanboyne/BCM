# Dianosis 

## Emergent Causes: 4+2+2
- **Cardiac**: Acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, tamponade, takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome)
- **Pulmonary**: Pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax
- **Esophageal**: Rupture, impaction

Once we rule these out, we can move on to anotomic causes:

### Anatomic causes

#### MSK
- Costrochondritis
- Rib fracture
- Strain
- Infection, cancer

#### Skin
- Herpes Zoster

#### Nervous
- Thoracic radiculopathy
- Anxiety

#### GI
- Spasm
- GI reflux
- Ulcer
- Biliary

#### Cardiac
- Heart Failure
- Aortic stenosis

#### Pulmonary 
- Pneumonia
- Pleuritis

#### Mediastinum
- Fat necrosis

## HPI

Look out for the following:
- Eating steak... --> impaction
- Right side --> lungs
- Lightning shock --> not typical of any life threatening problems
- Just pressure --> MI
- Hurts to breath, lie down --> pleuritic or pericarditis
- Straight to back --> aortic dissection
- Every time I go upstairs --> stable angina
- Right leg swollen --> PE

Really try not to put words in pt. mouth. Not multiple choice question.

### Cardiovascular ROS
- Chest discomfort
- Exertional capacity and symptoms
- Palpitations
- SOB
    - on exertion
    - paroxsymal nocturnal dyspnea
    - orthopnea
- Lightheadedness
- Fainting
- Swellin (weight gain)

### Peripheral vascular
- Pain/cramping in leg
- ulcers on feet
- changes in skin, hair, sensations, temp
- extremity swelling
- pain after eating

![Cardio Exam](/img/cardio_exam.png)

Pulses:
- absent
- 1+ weak
- 2+ normal
- 3+ bounding

Jugulars: give idea of RAP which approximates CVP
1. Find jugulars: venous pulsations or distension
2. Find height about sternal angle (about 10 cm above RA)
3. Add 10 and report JVP as one number (cm water)

Arterial is monophasic with prominent outward movement, palpable. Venous is biphasic with prominent inward movement, not palpable. If you can't see anything, obstruct the EJA or make them lie flat and observe.

### Murmurs

* Grade (out of 6)
    - (1/6) soft, medium, loud, thrill, thrill + audible with 1/2 lifted, audible (6/6)
* Occurrence (systolic vs diastolic, early vs. late etc)
    - Systolic after S1 (lubshhh-dub), diastolic after S2 (lub-dubshhh)
* Description/character:sound quality, pitch, shape, extra sounds
    - Harsh, soft musical, rumbling, high pitch (diaphragm) or low pitch (bell)
    - Holosystolic (same throughout), crescendo-decresendo, decresendo, decresendo-crescendo
* Area Where heard, or heard loudest
* Radiation e.g. to carotid, axilla, etc
    - Aortic stenosis/sclerosis → neck, clavicle, throughout precordium
    - Mitral regurgitation → axilla
* Maneuvers: how intensity changes with… increased preload or increased afterload

Occurence + location key for valve lesions:
- If open, murmur occurs when stenosed
- If closed, murmur occurs when regurgitating

#### Common murmurs
All day every day:
- Flow murmurs (quiet, over pulmonic, crescendo-decrescendo)

Common:
- Aortic stenosis/sclerosis
- Mitral regurgitation
- Tricuspid regurgitation

Less common, but important:
- Aortic regurgitation (e.g. from endocarditis)
- Mitral stenosis (caused by rheumatic fever)

Non-valvular murmurs: VSD, hypertrophic obstrutive cardiomyopathy, PDA

#### S3 & S4
- S3 gallop due to early diastolic filling into dilated (vol overloaded) LV or RV (**hear will bell**)
- S4 gallop from atrial kick pumping into stiff (pressure overloaded) LV or RV

#### Pericardial
- Rubs and knocks
    - Acute pericarditis: acute friction rub
    - Pericardial knock with constrictive pericarditis (similar to S3)

# Communicating in Medicine

### General Principles

**Organization**
- Grammar of clinical communication
- Different sections of facts v. opinions

**Efficiency**
- High signal to noise, report relavant info in fewest # syllables

**Engagement**
- Pacing, tone, eye contact, and simple language

### History
1. Name, reason for visit, HPI
- Age, history, current complaint and duration
- Chronological narrative of illness
- Relevant ROS, risk factors
- Patient perspective
2. Med-surg hx and meds
- Medical history as mentioned above + any details and other medical problems not mentioned
- Surgeries
- Read list of meds (don't give indications or doses, unless unusual)
3. Allergies: list 'em
4. Social/health behaviours
- Fam support and living situaiton, occupation
- Tobacco, alcohol, drug use
- Other things as relevant
5. Fam hx: only relevant (i.e. no history of any related or relevant conditions)

ROS: usually not gone over in verbal presentation as those that are you put it in HPI

### Physical
1. Vitals
2. General appearance
3. Head-to-toe
- Help listener visualize patient and simplify language when necessary

### Summary statement
Encapsulate clinical picture: 1-2 sentences distilling highlights: "middle aged man w hx of heavy smoking and CAD, here with xyz. ROS physical highlights..."

## Systemic Edema
- Think first: Heart failure and Cirrhosis (sometimes evident in physical), Nephrotic Syndrome (need serum/urine labs)
- Think second: low albimin, vascular leak, meds, endocrine, excessive salt

## Syncope Case
- Transient loss of conciousness due to loss of perfusion to the brain
- Reflex: Vasovagal (stress, heat), Situational (sneeze, pee, poo), Other (carotids)
- Orthostatic: Decreased autonomic activity (neurodegenerative or systemic issues), Meds (alpha blocker, BP meds, TCAs), low-volume/postprandial
- Cardiogenic: Arrythmias (AV block, SVT, VT) and structural (aortic stenosis, tamponade, PE, HOCM)
- Can present similarly to seizure, stroke, and hypoglycemia

- Sudden, witnessed, transient syncope in previously healthy middle aged woman in warm environment. No twitching during episode, groggy afterwards.
