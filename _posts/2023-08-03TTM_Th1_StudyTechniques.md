### Memory formation
 - Encoding: sense info into short term memory
 - Consolidation: transfer to long term
 - Retrieval
 - Updating
 
### Stress
 
 More than an emotion. Catecholamines and corticosteroids released. 
 
 Catecholamines include epinepherine and noradrenaline which peak in seconds (released from sympathetic NS) leading to fight or flight and increase neural activity (activates memory formation and learning).
 
 Corticosteroids (cortisol) peak after 20-30 minutes and bind to different receptors:
  - Mineralocorticoid receptors: Rapid bindings that increase neural excitability and learning
  - Glucocorticoid receptors: Slower bindings that decrease neural excitability and return body to homeostasis. This creates lull in learning capabilities.
  
 Stress immediatley before or slightly after encoding information improves learning. Chronic stress prior to encoding, as well as before retrival and updating impairs learning.
 
 Practically, acute stress can improve learning. Steps to reduce stress at time of retrival (i.e. practice exams and thorough rehearsal) can improve long term retrival and performance.
 
### Learning Strategies

 - Spaced Repetition: Process to increase long term retention. Flatten slope of forgetting curve via spaced review 
 
 - Interleaving: Mix order of subject review to increase connections between different topics and improve overall retention.
 
 - Testing Effect: Active learning that helps improve retrival. Good even if you get it wrong.
 
 - Adaptive Learning: use experience to increase learning. Find gaps in your knowledge, prioritize what you need/what is in scope, then learn and apply.
 
 - Pomodoro: Choose task and set timer for work interval. Work with focus until timer goes off then take a short break. (25:5 or 25:10)
