## Pharmacodynamics

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Studies the mechanisms and effects of medications within the body. It essentially examines what medications do to the body and how they achieve their effects.

- **Receptors**: Specialized proteins on or inside cells that bind to ligands.
  - Ligands can be **agonists**, which activate the receptor, leading to a cascade of signals within the cell, resulting in some form of cellular response.

- **Desensitization and Tolerance**: 
  - Continuous exposure to the same agonist can lead to a decreased cellular response. 
  - **Desensitization** (or **Tachyphylaxis**): Rapid decrease in receptor response upon repeated exposure to an agonist.
  - **Tolerance**: Gradual decrease in receptor response over time with repeated exposure to an agonist.

- **Mechanisms of Desensitization and Tolerance**:
  1. **Downregulation**: Reduced synthesis of new receptors.
  2. **Sequestration/Internalization**: Increased endocytosis and degradation of existing receptors.
  3. **Receptor Uncoupling**: Receptors are modified so they can't activate secondary messenger proteins.
  4. **Exhaustion of Intermediate Messengers**: Depletion of necessary intermediate molecules; for example, depletion of amines in response to amphetamine.
  5. **Increased Metabolic Breakdown**: Enhanced production of enzymes that metabolize the drug, like in chronic alcohol use.
  6. **Decreased Metabolism**: Tolerance due to decreased breakdown, as seen with nitrovasodilators.
  7. **Physiological Adaptation**: Body adapts to counteract the effects of the drug, as seen with diuretics and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Agonists and Antagonists

  - **Agonists**: Medications that activate receptors. 
    - **Full Agonists**: Can produce the maximal possible response for a receptor when bound.
    - **Partial Agonists**: Produce a response that is less than the maximal response, even when all receptors are occupied.

  - **Antagonists**: Medications that prevent receptor activation.
    - **Competitive Antagonists**: Reversibly bind to the same receptor site as an agonist but do not activate it. Their effects can be overcome by increasing the amount of agonist.
    - **Non-Competitive Antagonists**: Bind to a different part of the receptor (allosteric site) or bind irreversibly, preventing activation by agonists. Their effects cannot be overcome by increasing the amount of agonist.

- **Graphical Representation**:
  - The dose-response curve shows the relationship between drug dose and its effect.
  - **Emax**: The maximal effect a drug can produce.
  - **ED50**: The dose of a drug required to produce 50% of its maximal effect.
  - **Potency**: The dose of a drug required to produce a maximal response.
  - **Efficacy**: The maximal effect that a drug can produce.

- **Effect of Competitive Antagonists**: They shift the dose-response curve to the right, increasing ED50 (decreasing potency) but not affecting Emax (efficacy remains the same).
- **Effect of Non-Competitive Antagonists**: They reduce Emax (decreasing efficacy) but do not affect the position or shape of the curve (potency remains the same).

## Enzymes

**Enzymes and their Role:**
- Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts, speeding up biochemical reactions.
- They help transform substrates into products, reducing the activation energy required.
- Without enzymes, many reactions would be too slow to support life.

**Reaction Coordinate Diagram:**
- Shows the progression of a biochemical reaction.
- **ΔG**: Gibbs free energy; difference in energy between substrate and product.
- **ΔG‡++**: Activation energy; energy barrier a substrate needs to overcome to reach the transition state.

**Enzyme Action:**
- Enzymes have an active site where substrates bind, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.
- Enzymes stabilize the transition state, reducing the activation energy and speeding up the reaction.
- Each enzyme is specific to its substrate.

**Enzyme Kinetics:**
- **Michaelis Menten Graph**: Plots substrate concentration ([S]) against reaction velocity (V).
  - **Vmax**: Maximum reaction speed when all enzyme sites are saturated.
  - **Km**: Substrate concentration at half of Vmax. Inversely reflects enzyme affinity.

- **Lineweaver-Burke Plot**: A double reciprocal plot of the Michaelis Menten equation.
  - Y-intercept = 1/Vmax
  - X-intercept = -1/Km

**Factors Affecting Enzyme Action:**
- **Agonists and Antagonists**: Substances that can increase or decrease enzyme activity, respectively.
  - **Induction**: Increases gene expression, leading to increased enzyme production.
  - **Repression**: Decreases gene expression, leading to decreased enzyme production.
  - **Up-regulation**: Increases the number of receptors or transporters on a cell's surface.
  - **Down-regulation**: Decreases the number of receptors or transporters on a cell's surface.
- **Competitive Inhibition**: When a molecule binds to an enzyme's active site, blocking the substrate.
- **Non-Competitive Inhibition**: When a molecule binds to an allosteric site, changing the enzyme's shape and preventing substrate binding.

**Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation**: 
- Change an enzyme's shape and affect its activity.
- Kinases add phosphate groups (phosphorylation) while phosphatases remove them (dephosphorylation).
