## Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

SLE is an autoimmune disease involving the skin, joints, CNS, and kidneys. It primarily affects women of child bearing age. People of African origin have higher incidence and tend to develop the disease earlier with a higher tendency toward ESRD (via lupus nephritis). It is typically considered a type III hypersensitivity reaction.

### Risk Factors
- **Genetic Risk Factors**: complement component C1Q, C2, and C4 single gene defects are strongly associated with SLE. These are thought to contribute to SLE via impaired clearance of cellular debris leading to high availablity of nucleic acid-containing cell products to trigger autoimmunity. Other gene loci including IFN-IRF5 associated with interfereons may be implicated. HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 are MHC loci associated with SLE.
- **Environmental Risk Factors**: UV light exposure, Epstein-Barr infection, and hormonal (increased estrogen/progesterone, low dehydroepiandrosterone) factors may initiate disease. Certain drugs may also result in drug-induced SLE, a milder but serologically similar disease process that usually resolves with withdrawl of the offending drug. Smoking is also a risk factor.

For board exams, the classic drugs include isoniazid, hydralazine, and procainamide. 

### Diagnosis

#### Antibody Tests

The most specific SLE antibodies are anti-Smith (Sm) antibodies which are directed against spliceosome components, and anti-dsDNA antibodies. Targets of autoantibodies associated with disease are listed below:

* Neuropsychiatric SLE: ribosomal-P proteins (phosphorylated proteins of the ribosome complex) and neuronal antigens
* Lupus nephritis: C1q, dsDNA and Smith (Sm)
* Subacute cutaneous lupus and secondary Sjögren syndrome: Ro (Sjögren syndrome-related antigen A (SSA)) and La (SSB)
* Interstitial lung disease and shrinking lung syndrome: U1 ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) and Ro (SSA)
* Lupus arthritis: Sm
* Autoimmune haemeolytic anaemia: red blood cells
* Thrombocytopaenia: platelets
* Leukocytopaenia: dsDNA
* Antiphospholipid syndrome: prothrombin and β2-glycoprotein 1
* Congenital fetal heart block and neonatal lupus: Ro (SSA)

The antibodies themselves and their sensitivity/specificity for SLE are listed below:

* Anti-dsDNA – Highly specific for SLE. Rising levels correlate with increased SLE activity and an increased risk for SLE nephritis. Seen in approximately 55%-65% of SLE patients
* Anti-Smith (anti-Sm) – Highly specific for SLE. Seen in approximately 25%-30% of SLE patients. Considerable diagnostic value, but levels do not correlate with disease activity
* Anti-RNP – Highly specific for SLE. Seen in approximately 5% of SLE patients.
* Antinuclear antibody (ANA) – Highly sensitive for SLE. Seen in approximately 99% of SLE patients. In other words, it is very rare for an individual with SLE to have a negative ANA. Considerable screening value, but levels do not correlate with disease activity. Often, 1:160 is used as a cutoff for a positive test. 
* Anti-histones – Highly specific for drug-induced SLE.

#### EULAR/ACR Criteria [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827566/)

The European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology formed the followign criteria for inclusion of patients into clinical trials for SLE:

You will also often see low C3 and C4 levels along with a low C50 test.

#### Differentials
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Fibromyalgia
* Mixed connective tissue disease – Check for anti-U1RNP antibody. Most patients are positive for this in mixed connective tissue disease.
* Scleroderma – Check for anticentromere antibodies and anti-Scl-70 antibodies. Typified by sclerotic changes in skin not seen in dermatomyositis.
* Systemic sclerosis
* Drug-induced SLE
* Dermatomyositis (DM) – Characteristic heliotrope rash (violaceous plaques surrounding the eyes), photodistributed cutaneous eruption, and nail fold changes. Look for elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK) levels and proximal symmetric extremity weakness. Erythema of DM is more violaceous than SLE. While in SLE erythematous macules and plaques on the dorsal fingers occur both in between and over joints, in DM they tend to favor joints (atrophic dermal papules of dermatomyositis, formerly called Gottron papules).
* Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome / lupus anticoagulant – Can overlap with SLE; associated with recurrent thromboses and spontaneous abortions, elevated prothrombin time (PT).
* Polymyositis – Without cutaneous findings.
* Sarcoidosis
* Systemic amyloidosis

### Pathophysiology
Innate and adaptive immune systems direct an inappropriate immune response to nucleic acid-containing cellular particles. DNA enriched in endogenous retrotransposon sequences are potential stimuli for endosomal TLRs and TLR-independed sensors cause type I IFN production and associated immune dysfunction via the JAK-STAT pathway. Activation of DCs by these IFNs also promotes the activation of anti-self adaptive immunity. 

T-cells express over-activy CD40L, leading to high numbers of activated B-cells. Over time, class switching to IgG vs. IgM seems to promote disease progression as IgG is more easily able to access extravascular spaces. 

Many patients also have antiphospholipid antibodies which may or may not be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. These increase risk of thrombosis, increase the PTT (lupus anticoagulant), and can result in false positive syphilis tests (anti-cardiolipin)

### Disease Progression
- **Skin and joints**: migratory, symmetrical, polyarticular arthritis
    - Malar rash (especially after sun exposure). Discoid rashes and edematous, erythematous papaules and plaques on the trunk are also possible.
- **Heme**: Many patientts are anemic or pancytopenic. Note this is a type II hypersensitivity reaction (all others are type III)
- **Renal**: about half of patients will experience varying degrees of glomerulonephritis (typiclly DPGN) which in many cases progresses to ESRD.
- **Other**: Antiphosphilipid thromboembolic disease, GI, pulmonary, cognitive (lupus cerebritis = confusion, memory loss, seizure) and cardiac involvement (atherosclerosis, Limbman-Sacks endocarditis) are also possible. SLE patients are at a higher risk for hematological, cervical, breast, and lung cancer.

Therapies, especially glucocorticoids, can lead to comorobitidies including cataract, osteopenia, recurrent infections, etc.

### Other forms of Lupus

- **Drug induced**: see above
- **Neonatal**: maternal antibodies cross the placenta. Highly associated with maternal Sjögren's syndrome but may also be seen in SLE. Caused by SSA/Ro or SSB/La antibodies which results in multiple red circular lesions on face and scalp. They then develop congenital complete heart block which does not respond to steroids and requires permanent pacemaker.
- **Lupus dermatitis**: less severe lupus which is cutaneously limited and may or may not progress to SLE.

### Treatments

SLE is treated via initiation of glucocorticoids (often IV prednisone) and immunosupresive agents. Understreatment can lead to insufficient immunosuppression and tissue damage, while overtreatment increases risk of steroid-induced comorbidities. Steroid tapering is often accomplished by starting immunosupressive therapy initiation early in steroid treatment. Hydroxycloroquine is the immunosupressive drug of choice in mild SLE, but AZA and MMF are often used in case of renal involvement. Rituximab has also been investigated as a therapy. Belimumab (anti BAFF IgG monoclonal Ab) is used for refractory SLE. Lupus limited to cutaneous regions may respond well to sun avoidance and creams (glucocorticoid and tacrolimus).

Historically, severe lupus nephritis treatment was initiated with combination glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. However, MMF is non-inferior to cyclophosphamide and has a more favorable side effect profile. Combination cyclophosphamide/AZA or Rituximab are other options. Maintenance is usually accomplished with AZA or MMF. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often used for renoprotection. 

### Disease Prognosis

Fatigue affects QOL profoundly and is present in up to 80% of patients with SLE. Fatigue, often perceived as a feature of active lupus, is a multifactorial symptom with a questionable relationship with disease activity. Other factors that potentially contribute to fatigue are obesity, low physical activity, poor sleep quality, mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and vitamin D deficiency. Although fatigue is often recalcitrant, studies suggest that treatment with calcifediol (a vitamin D precursor) results in a small but significant reduction in fatigue in patients with vitamin D-deficient SLE. In addition, post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials of belimumab have shown a decreased degree of fatigue among responders, although this drug cannot be recommended exclusively for the treatment of SLE-associated fatigue.

Changes in appearance due to steroid therapy can be devestaing, especially in younger female patients. Up to 20% of patients cease employment within 10 years of initial diagnosis. 

## Diagnostic Uncertainty [[ref]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789773)

Diagnostic uncertainty has been defined as the “subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient’s health problem.” Tolerating uncertainty rather than trying to reduce it to absolute certainty requires a major shift in the clinician’s mindset. Current medical education inadequately prepares early-career clinicians for feelings of failure associated with diagnostic uncertainty. Instead of upholding the illusion of certainty, medical education and professional development should provide a judgment-free opportunity for clinicians to openly and safely reflect, as well as be guided by and learn to live with the stress associated with diagnostic uncertainty.

Patients’ expectations change as they gain a more transparent understanding of the complex and often complicated pathway to diagnosis. Clinicians can build safety nets by alerting patients about their uncertainty, discussing red-flag symptoms, and codeveloping plans of when and where patients should seek additional or urgent help.
