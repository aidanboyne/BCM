## Milestones

### Developmental

![milestones](/img/development_milestone.png)

### Growth Charts

The WHO publishes growth charts for children 0-2 years old, after which the CDC publishes growth charts up to 20 years old. These charts include weight fo height, head circumference for age, height for age, and weight for age percentiles for both males and females. Example charts can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who-charts.html)

### Vaccine Schedule [[ref]](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html)

The CDC publishes pediatric and adult immunization schedules. 

- [Pediatric Schedule](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/assets/docs/PediatricVaccination.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Adult Schedule](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/assets/docs/AdultVaccination.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

In the first 15 months, infants should recieve RSV, HepB, Rotavirus (RV), Diptheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTaP), H. Flu type B (HiB), Pneumococcal conjugate, poliovirus, COVID-19, Influenza, MMR, Varicella, and HepA. Infants with anatomic or functional asplenia, HIV infection, terminal complement deficiency, or complement inhibitor use should recieve meningococcal serogroup ACWY vaccinations.

#### MMR Vaccine [[ref]](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html)

The MMR vaccine is an **attenuated** viral vaccine. Children should get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination. Two MMR vaccines are available for use in the United States, M-M-R II and PRIORIX.  M-M-R II and PRIORIX are fully interchangeable for all indications for which MMR vaccination is recommended. Children may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.

### Respiratory Complications of Preterm Birth [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532824/)

Preterm birth predisposes individuals to the development of chronic respiratory disease in adulthood, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Worldwide, it has been estimated that more than 15 million babies (11% of live births) are born preterm. Health complications associated with preterm birth have recently been implicated as the cause of 36% (1.03 million) of neonatal deaths. Rates of preterm birth are increasing in most countries with reliable data. In 2010, it was estimated that the rate of preterm births in the United States was 12%, accounting for 42% of all preterm births in developed regions, and approximately 90% of preterm infants survive. Infants born most preterm, during the late canalicular or saccular stage of lung development, have the greatest burden of early respiratory disease, putting them at greatest risk for later pulmonary morbidity.

Mechanical ventilation can cause interstital thickening, fibrosis, airway epithelial meteplasia, and SM hypertrophy. Antenatal steroids and exogenous surfactant therapy have been shown to reduce these complications, but there is still persistent decrease in available surface area due to decreased alveolar counts. Longer term complications of bronchopulmonary dysplasia include restricted growth and high risk of asthma.

| Bug | Disease | Rash | Progression | Other Symptoms |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Streptococcus pyogenes   | Scarlet fever | Erythematous, sandpaper-like with numerous papules | Groin/axilla → trunk and extremities, sparing palms and soles<br>Rash is followed by desquamation | Fever<br>Sore throat<br>Nausea |
| Staphylococcus aureus   | Toxic Shock Syndrome | Sunburn-like (diffuse, erythematous, macular) with desquamation on palms and soles | Trunk and neck → extremities | High fever<br>Severe systemic illness |
| Rickettsia rickettsii | RMSF | Blanching, erythematous macules → Petechial | Wrists/ankles → trunk. Rash then appears in later stage disease on the palms and soles | Fever<br>Headache |
| Treponema pallidum | Secondary syphilis | Copper-colored maculopapular, including palms and soles | Diffuse | Condylomata lata<br>Alopecia (patchy)<br>Constitutional symptoms<br>Lymphadenopathy |
| Borrelia burgdorferi | Lyme disease | Erythema chronicum migrans (expanding target-shaped red rash) | Expanding circle | Flu-like symptoms |
| Coxsackievirus type A | Hand, foot, and mouth | Vesicular | Palms and soles only | Ulcers in mouth |
| Rubella virus | German measles (Rubella) | Maculopapular | Head → body<br>Lasts 3 days | Postauricular lymphadenopathy<br>Congenital rubella in fetus |
| Rubeola virus | Measles | Maculopapular | Head → entire body<br>Becomes confluent as it spreads downward | 3 C's<br>Koplik spots |
| Mumps virus | Mumps | None | None | Parotitis<br>Orchitis |
| VZV | Chickenpox | Asynchronous | Trunk → face/extremities | Fever<br>Pharyngitis<br>Malaise |
| HHV-6 | Roseola infantum | Blanching, maculopapular, occurs after fever | Neck/trunk → face/extremities | High fever followed by rash (separatd temporally)<br>Affects infants |
| Parvovirus B19 | Erythema infectiosum | "Slapped cheek" | Face → body | Hydrops fetalis in pregnant women |

To be honest, all the rashes in measles and rubella look identical to me so I didn't add pictures. Mumps does not have a rash, and instad may cause parotitis.

## Pediatric Rash Differential

### Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) [[ref]](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC3334858&blobtype=pdf)

* **Measles**: RNA virus in Morbillivirus genus and _Paramyxoviridae_ family.
    - Respiratory transmission, highest in late winter/spring
    - Increased risk in low vaccination environments
    - 10-12d prodromal phase with fever, anorexia and malaise with cough, conjunctivitis, and **coryza** (inflammation of mucous membrane.).
    - End of prodromal phase has pathognomonic **Koplik's** spots (blue-white buccal enanthem) followed by rash and persisting cough.
    - Complications include diarrhea, otitis media, penumonia, and rarley encephalitis.
    - Diagnosis can be made via viral culture and serological assays (ELISA, IgM capture)
* **Mumps**: RNA virus in Rubulavirus genus and _Paramyxoviridae_ family
    - Oral droplet transmission 
    - Prodromal phase (14-18d) with malaise, myalgia, fever, anorexia. About 30% of people develop paratoditis. 
    - Complications include aseptic memingitis, pancreatitis, oophoritis, and rareley meningioencephalitis/deafness.
    - Diagnosed via viral culture, PCR, or IgM/IgG ELISA tests.
- **Rubella**: RNA virus in the genus Rubivirus within the _Togaviridae_ family.
    - Transmission via respiratory droplets with prolonged infectious period
    - Often asymptomatic. Prodromal phase (1-5d) of fever, lymphadenopathy, and URI.
    - **Forchheimer** spots (petechiae on soft palate) may preceed mild maculopapular rash beginning on face and spreading _downward_.
    - Nearly always leads to arthralgia and arthritis in women. 
    - Transplacental transmission can cause devestating congenital rubella syndrome characterized by fetal death, prematurity, ocular deformaties, neurological deficits, abnormal cardiac development, and most commonly **deafness**. Delayed manifestations include type I diabetes, inetellecutal disability, and subacute encephalitis. Worse outcome with earlier gestational age at infection. 

### Other Rashes

Common childhood rashes are detailed in the table below [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0801/p211.html):

![Childhood Rashes](/img/childhood_rashes.gif)

- Roseola Infantum: **HHV6** affecting infants and children younger than 3 years. High and acute onset fever with mild cold symptoms. No treatment is required
- Pityriasis Rosea: thought to be caused by **HHV6-8**. Mild URT symptoms and possible itching.
- Scarlet Fever: common result (10%) of **streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis** caused by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin). Preceeded by sore throat, the rash spares palms and soles and spreads quickly. Diagnosed with throat culture or rapid antigen test and treated with penicillin.
- Impetigo: bullous or non-bullous. Cuased by **S. Aureus** and **S. Pyogenes**. Usually treated with topical antibiotics such as mupirocin.
- Erythema Infectiosum (aka fifth disease): **parvovirus B19** infection leading to low-grade fever, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed by 2-4d rash. Rarely leads to arthralgia. Symptomatic treatment. 
- Molluscum Contagiosum: **poxvirus** infection causing flesh-colored papules with umbilication
- Tinea: fungal infection most commonly due to **Trichophyton** and **Microsporum**. Variants classified by area affected. Includes Tinea _capitis_ (B), _corporis_ (C), _cruris_ (D), _pedis_ (E), unguium (on nails). _Malassezia spp._ is a yeast-like "spag-meatball" (H) fungus causing tinea versicolor (G).
    ![Tinea Infections](/img/tinea.png)
- Atopic Dermatitis: lesions on extensor surfaces in kids, flexor in adults. Dry, flaky skin with high risk of secondary infection.

In general, viral examanthems are widespread rashes caused by a toxin reaction, skin damage, or immune response. Causitive organisms include some mentioned above (measles, rubella, roseola, parvovirus B19) and varicella. Other causes include hepatitis, mononucelosis (CMV, EBV).

Bacterial rashes not mentioned above include toxic shock syndrome (caused by toxin producing S. Aureus) and toxic shock-like syndrome (GAS) with a sunburn type rash, staphlococcal scladed skin syndrome, and rickettsial diseases.

Non-infectious rashes include morbilliform drug eruptions, drug hypersensitivity syndromes, and SJS/TEN.

### Concerning Signs

Rashes or lesions affecting the eyes are a major cause of concern and require opthomology consult. Serious bullae should be further evaluated. Blue or purple dots indicating vasculitis or stiff neck or severe voimiting are all other reasons for extended workup.

## Pharmacology

### Antipyretics [[ref]](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/127/3/e20103852/65016/Fever-and-Antipyretic-Use-in-Children)

The most common parental mistakes with antipyretics include a misconception on concerning fever (anything less than 101 does not necessarily need antipyretics) and dosing error (should be based on weight rather than age or degree of fever).

There is no evidence that children with fever, as opposed to hyperthermia, are at increased risk of adverse outcomes such as brain damage. Fever is a common and normal physiologic response that results in an increase in the hypothalamic “set point” in response to endogenous and exogenous pyrogens. Hyperthermia is a rare and pathological response with warning signs such as hot and dry skin with delerium, convulsions, or coma. Temperatures above 41C (105.8F) should always be treated, while fevers at or below 104F are generally not inherently dangerous. 

In generally healthy children, both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are effective and safe. Acetaminophen is preferred due to better side effet profile.
