## Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Most information and graphics are from this [excellent review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-023-00452-3) by Bekker et al.

### Viral Lifecycle

HIV virions are spherical structures comprised of two positive sense ssRNA strands surrounded by a capsid and outer lipid bilayer cotaining key glyocoproteins gp120 and gp41. HIV primarily infects CD4+ T-cells but also can infect macrophages and microglial cells via gp120 binding to CD4+ TCR and coreceptor CCR5 (which affect both macrophages and CD4+ T-cells) or CXCR4 (which almost exclusivley affect CD4+ T-cells). 

The gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins are formed via cleavage and posttranslational modification of gp160. This process is a target of many therapies. After fusing, the +ssRNA is transcribed into cDNA via a reverse transcriptase which is prone to error, leading to huge viral gene diversity. Finally, cDNA strands come together to form dsDNA which is integrated into the host DNA via integrase. New viruses are then transcribed via host RNA polymerase.

### HIV-1 and HIV-2 [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23444290/#)

HIV-1 and HIV-2 share many similarities including their basic gene arrangement, modes of transmission, intracellular replication pathways and clinical consequences: both result in AIDS. However, HIV-2 is characterised by lower transmissibility and reduced likelihood of progression to AIDS. In terms of epidemiology, HIV-2 remains largely confined to West Africa, whereas HIV-1 extends worldwide. Clinically, HIV-2 infected individuals seem to dichotomise, most remaining long-term non-progressors, whereas most HIV-1 infected individuals progress. When clinical progression occurs, both diseases demonstrate very similar pathological processes, although progression in HIV-2 occurs at higher CD4 counts. 

### Transmission and Protection

The majority of HIV is transmitted via vaginal or anal sex. Other routes of transmission include IV drug use (sharing of needles) and delivery/breastfeeding. Protection methods include:
- Condoms: 71% reduction in transmission
- Circumcision: Circumsized males are about 60% less likley to acquire HIV than uncircumsized males.
- Harm reduction (methadone/buprenorphine and needle distribution programmes)
- PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis): antiretroviral use in HIV-negative individuals (usually via tenofovir) reduces risk of infection by 86-92%
- PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis): more effective if initiated ASAP. Triple therapy continued for 28 days.

### Presentation and Diagnosis

Acute infection presents with a short flu-like illness (fever, sore throat, rash, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and lymphadenopathy) 2-6 weeks following exposure. However, latent infection is asymptomatic and may remain latent for many years. HIV is initially undetectable by available tests:
- Nucleic acid test: 10 day eclipse, may not detect HIV-2 infection
- 3rd-5th gen (recombinant and synthetic peptides): 2 week eclipse. Detect IgG/IgM antibodies and p24 (the most abundant HIV antigen)
- 2nd gen: 4-6 week eclipse. IgG only with differentiation of HIV1 and 2
- 1st gen: 8-10 week eclipse. Crude viral lysate detects IgG of HIV1

One issue with increased testing is the potential for false postive. However, serial testing with highly sensitive and specific tests (as per WHO reccomendation) reduces this risk.


### Treatment

Six classes of antiretroviral medication, which each target unique steps of the HIV life cycle, have been approved for clinical use:
- Entry/Fusion inhibitors: Maraviroc, Ibalizumab, Fostemsavir, Enfuvirtide. Selectivley inhibit entry into CD4+ T-cells either by binding to gp41 or by preventing CCR5/gp120 interaction.
- Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): Lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir, abacavir. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs without a 3' hydroxl which terminate DNA chains as they pass through reverse transcriptase as the normal phosphodiester bond cannot form.
- NNRTIs: Rilpivirine, efavirenz, etravirine, doravirine. Bind reverse transcriptase as a allosteric inhibitor.
- INSTIs: Bictegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir, raltegravir, cabotegravir. Bind viral integrase, preventing incorporation of viral DNA into host cell genome.
- Protease inhibitors (PIs): Darunavir, atazanavir. Inhibit gag/pol polyprotein cleavage leading to non-infectious virons.
- Capsid inhibitors: Lenacapavir. Binds to HIV-1 capsid protein p24 interfering with viral assembly and release.

Incomplete adherence to ART can result in ongoing HIV replication, which in the presence of drugs enables the emergence of resistance. Development of resistance can lead to virological failure (the inability to maintain viral suppression below 200 copies/ml). Once resistance emerges, it can be transmitted to others. Notably, individuals on ART with plasma HIV-1 RNA suppressed below 1,000 copies/ml are very unlikely to transmit HIV-1, and **those below 200 copies/ml cannot transmit HIV-1**.

Only a few individuals have achieved HIV eradication. These cases occurred in the context of cancer treatment that involved stem cell transplantation using cells from donors with the CCR5Δ32 mutation, hence natural resistance to HIV infection.

#### HAART [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10337461/#)

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) refers to a broad category of treatment regimens comprised of 3_ antiretrovirals in that aim to reduce viral titers to undetectable levels in previously untreated patients. Most HAART regimens include drugs from at least two of the three classes of antiretroviral therapy (nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, non-nucleoside analog RT inhibitors, and protease inhibitors). Typically, HIV-1 RNA levels will drop to about 1% of original value within 1-2 weeks of initiating HAART.

#### Reporting [[ref]](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/hivstd/info/edmat/HIVandTexasLaw.pdf)

Health care providers and laboratories are required to report HIV via a confidential case report form. The patient must be given an oppurtunity for immediate, face-to-face counseling about the test and available services. Minors have the right to consent to HIV testing and treatment. Pregnant women must be tested for HIV (and syphilis + HepB) at their first prenatal visit and during the thrid trimester (if third trimester results are not available, expitited tests for HIV and syphilis must be conducted at delivery).

In some cases, Texas law allows a physician to "require" that a patient undergo an HIV test. Texas law provides that a person (such as a physician) may require another person to have an HIV test if a medical procedure is to be performed on the person that could expose health care personnel to AIDS or HIV infection, according to Board guidelines defining the conditions that constitute possible exposure to AIDS or HIV infection, and there is sufficient time to receive the test result before the procedure is conducted. 

Texas law allows disclosure of a positive HIV test result to the patient's spouse without the patient's consent (Texas Health & Safety Code, §81.103).

#### Ryan White Program [[ref]](https://ryanwhite.hrsa.gov/)

Ryan White was a 13 year old hemopheliac who was diagnosed with AIDS due to blood transfusion. The HIV/AIDS Bureau provides a comprehensive system of HIV primary medical care, medications, and essential support service for low-income people with HIV via the Ryan White program established in Ryan's memory in 1990. Over 575k patients were served by the program in the US in 2021.


## AIDS

### HIV to AIDS

The primary infection is characterised in an initial burst of viral replication with accompanying increase in CD8+ killing of the T-cells which results in a gradual decline in CD4+ T-cell levels (average of 50-100 cells/microliter/year). During this phase, hypergammaglobulinemia may develop, leading to autoimmune defects and macrophage dysfunction.

AIDS occurs when CD4+ T-cells fall below 200 cells/microliter, or when a range of specific clinical presentations arise. This can take around 8-10 years, but may progress more rapidly in some individuals or much more slowly in patients with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART).

![AIDS progression](/img/AIDS_progression.webp)

Even with effective ART, latent infection persists indefinitley and discontinuation of treatment will lead to reactivation of the virus, typically within 2-3 weeks.

### Oppurtunistic Infections
- **Mycobacterium avium**: very common oppurtunistic infection causing persistent bacteremia and infiltration of organ tissue leading to dysfunction (i.e. cavitary pulmonary lesions, pericarditis, CNS lesiosn, and osteomyelitis)
- **M. tuberculosis**: all patients should be tested at time of diagnosis unless they have had prior active and cured TB. 
- **Pneumocystis jirovecii**: Fever, progressive dyspnea, non-productive cough and hypoxemia with diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical interstitial infiltrates (ground glass) on X-ray.
- **T. gondii**: may cause focal encephalitis
- **Mucocutaneous Candidiasis**: Painless, creamy white plaque-like lesions in the oral cavity which scrape off easily. Angular cheilosis and retrosternal burning + odynophagia.
    - **Treatment [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11590489/)**: topical agents such as clotrimazole along with systemic antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole) are genearlly safe and effective treatment of candidiasis. **Esophageal Candidiasis** should _always_ be treated with systemic antifungals such as oral fluconazole.

See chart above for complete list.

## Kaposi Sarcoma

Soft tissue tumor usually occuring in patients with immonosupression, such as AIDS or transplant patients. It is an AIDS-defining malignancy.  It is associated with KSHV (HHV8). There are 4 epidemiological forms: AIDS-related, Iatrogenic (after solid-organ transplant), Endemic (sub-Saharan Africa, including children), and classic (older men with HHV8, especially middle east/east Europe/ Mediterranean)

![Kaposi OMG](/img/KHSV_karposi.PNG)

Like other herpesviruses, the KSHV virus persists as a latent infection indefinitley, largley due to its modulation of PI3K, MAPK, and NF-kB pathways. Clinically, kaposi sarcoma presents with multiple, pigmented, painless, non-blanching cutaneous lesions. AIDS-related KS often is accompanied by oral and visceral lesions. Endemic KS is associated with lymphoedema. Histology shows spindle cells replacing dermal collagen and extravasated RBC with haemosiderin in macrophages.

Treatment of AIDS via HAART often results in disease regression. Single agent liposomal anthacylcines can be used for advanced KS, and were shown to be superior to combination chemotherapy.

### Differentials [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534839/)
- **Histological** (spindal cell vascular lesions): certain granulomas, angiomas, dermatofibromas, and some other lesions.
- **Mucocutaneous**: nevi, pyogenic granulomas, bacillary angiomatosis, hemangioma, angiosarcoma, and melanoma.
