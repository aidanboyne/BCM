# Complete Medical History
Comprehensive health history is composed of 
 - Chief complaint
 - HPI
 - Past medical/surgical history
 - Meds
 - Allergies/adverse drug rxn
 - Family history
 - Social history of health related behavior
 - Review of systems

## Past Medical History (PMH)
 - Chronic illnesses: diabetes, arthritis, depression
 - Hospitalizations/severe acute illnesses
 - Past surgical history: appendectomy, hip replacement
 - OB/Gyn history: menstrual, pregnancies...
 - Health maintenance: immunizations, screening...
 
**Good Questioning**
 - "What medical problems do you have"
 - "What health conditions do you have"
 - Have you been hospitalized, had surgeries, get regular checkups/screenings, flu/covid/... shots, when?
 
**Documentation**

## Medications
 - prescribed, OTC, supplements/herbs
 - dose, route, frequency
 - know indication but don't write in section
 - use generic names

**Good Questioning**
 - "What medicines do you take at home"
 - Any injections, inhalers
 - Anything over counter, supplements/herbs?

What we really want to know isn't what is prescribed - it matters what they are actually taking. What is in the system may not be accurate - "I know it should be in computer but I just wanna make sure it's right".

## Adverse drug rxn and allergies
"Do you have any allergies to medications?" or "Have you ever taken any meds that you had a bad reaction to?". Mention the drug and time that it happened

## Family History

**Good Questioning**
 - What illnesses run in your family
 - (with context) Does anyone in your family have (kidney problems), (diabetes),...
 - Are your parents living, what heath problems do they have, how old were they when...

 ## Social history and health-related behaviors
  - SoDoH greatly affect health
  - Specific elements apply to specific situations (i.e. foot wound: did you step on seashell in Galveston?)

**Includes**

### For most encounters, document minimum
 - Home and household
 - Family and support: "Do you have family in town?"
 - Occupation
 - Tobacco, alcohol, substances: "Tell me about your use of alcohol... do you use any other drugs... any prescription use for non-medical reasons?"
 - Access/barriers to care (often addressed in plan of care later)

## Review of systems
 - Often asked to fill out in patient intake forms, but they don't pay attention or give significance to symptoms
 - Can be relevant to ask about "clusters" of symptoms for certain presentations
 - If stumped - need to hunt for clues or "shotgun"

#### General Review of systems
 - Unlocalized symptoms should always be reviewed i.e.
    - Fever
    - Weight loss
    - Fatigue
    - Change in appetite

Almost always included in the HPI already.

_Note_: See writeup guide for a good balance of depth and speed in medical history. Realistically, you can focus on either history or exam for individual patients to get good practice and note in your writeup.

# Chronic Illness

## OLDCARTS for chronic illness
 - Onset: how long has patient had illness
 - Location: who else/where else is managing condition
 - Diagnosis Details: how was diagnosis made, what workup to determine type/etiology
 - Control: symptoms and measurements... trends?
 - Aggravating/Alleviating: factors for symptoms or level of control, medical or psychosocial
 - Radiation/relationship: how does it impact life including other health conditions
 - Treatment: meds, lifestyle, therapies... barriers to adherence
 - Syndromes: what are complications associated with conditions and whether/how to prevent

"Can you tell me about your (glaucoma, diabetes...)", Anything else, when was diagnosed, do you know what type, how bad is it, how is it being treated, do you feel like they are helping, and concerns...?

## Population Health

Population health examines the outcomes of group of individuals who have something in common (i.e. patient assigned to physician, patients in city/neighborhood)

Outcomes can vary 
 - life expectancy
 - health QOL
 - cost of care

80% of patients 65+ have at least 1 chronic condition, and 68% have 2 or more. Chronic conditions include hypertension, high cholesterol, arthritis, coronary heart disease, diabetes, CKD, depression, COPD, heart failure...

### Elements and approaches
 - Data analysis
 - Health disparities/equity
 - Health promotion and illness prevention
 - Chronic disease management
 - Collaboration, policy, and advocacy

[AAFP](https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/patient_care/everyone_project/hops19-physician-form-sdoh.pdf) and [Neighborhood Navigator](https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/the-everyone-project/neighborhood-navigator.html) provide screening tool to point patients towards resources they might need in the community.


### Example Chronic Condition Assessment: Chronic Kidney Disease
 - Diagnostic Details: Presence of kidney damage and/or low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 ml/min per 1.73 square meters. Progressive disease. 
 - Control and Severity: Severity categorized by GFR
    - G1: GFR 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and above
    - G2: GFR 60 to 89 ml/min per 1.73 m2
    - G3a: GFR 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2
    - G3b: GFR 30 to 44 ml/min per 1.73 m2
    - G4: GFR 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2
    - G5: GFR less than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis

    Also includes the staging based on three levels of albuminuria

 - Aggravating/Alleviating Factors: uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and a diet high in sodium and processed foods. Alleviating factors involve managing underlying conditions, adopting a kidney-friendly diet, maintaining a healthy weight, controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and avoiding nephrotoxic medications.

 - Treatment/Barriers: Medications, low sodium/protein/phosphorus diets , and dialysis in severe cases. Dialysis access is particularly limited without transportation.

 - Syndromes associated: Metabolic disorders, cardiovascular complications in end stage disease, pericarditis or pleuritis (urgent indication), progressive uremic encephalopathy or neuropathy, with signs such as confusion, asterixis, myoclonus, and seizures (urgent indication)
