# Wound Healing

1. **Inflammatory Phase**: hemostasis, chemotaxis, and increased vascular permeability, limiting further damage, closing the wound, removing cellular debris and bacteria, and fostering cellular migration. Key molecules include PDGF, seratonin, and histamine. (5-7 days)
2. **Proliferative Phase**: formation of granulation tissue (fibroblasts and blood vessels in loose extracellular matrix). Macrophages release growth factors that promote proliferation and remodeling. (Ongoing process)
3. **Maturation**: collagen cross-linking and replacement of type III collagen with stronger type I collagen. Myofibroblasts may appear to facilitate wound contracture. (3+ weeks to 1 year)

Depending on the wound characteristics, scar may be minimal (primary intention) or significant (secondary intention).

## HLA 

The Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) system known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3) and contains the most polymorphic gene cluster of the entire human genome. Three regions of the gene are known as class I, II and III based on structure and function [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459467/)

Class I and class II molecules are essential for T Cell-mediated adaptive immunity. The foreign antigens recognized by the TCR are peptides produced by intracellular protein degradation which are bound to class I or class II molecules on the surface of human cells. In general, while endogenous antigens associated with HLA class I are recognized by CD8+ T Cells, exogenous peptides associate with HLA class II and are recognized by CD4+T Cells. 

- **Class I** (HLA-A, -B, and -C): present endogenous peptides to responding CD8+ T Cells. Other loci in this region code for the _non-classical_ HLA molecules such as HLA-E, -L, etc. These genes are upregulated by **IFN-gamma** via the JAK/STAT pathway
- **Class II** (HLA-DR, -DP, and –DQ): restricted expression and process exogenous peptides for presentation to CD4+ helper T Cells
- **Class III**: genes which encode for immune regulatory molecules, e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF), factors C3, C4, and C5 of complement and heat shock proteins.

# Hypersensitivity Reactions

Noteably, the vast majority (85-90%) of adverse drug reactions are _type A reactions_ which are **not** hypersenstivity reactions. These reactions are characterized by diarrhea, gastritis, and nephrotoxicity. _Type B reactions_ on the other hand, are mediated by inflammatory and immune processes. 

* **Type I** – Immediate in onset and mediated by IgE and mast cells and/or basophils. Type I reactions require the presence of drug-specific IgE. A small minority of patients form drug-specific IgE upon exposure to a medication, while most do not even with prolonged treatment. Once formed, drug-specific IgE occupies surface receptors on mast cells and basophils throughout the body. If the drug is encountered again, it (or its metabolite) may bind to these IgE molecules, causing crosslinking of the receptors and activation of the cells, resulting in symptoms.
   - The most common signs and symptoms are urticarial rash; pruritus; flushing; angioedema of the face, extremities, or laryngeal tissues (leading to throat tightness with stridor, or rarely asphyxiation); wheezing; gastrointestinal symptoms; and/or hypotension. Neither fever nor elevations in serum C-reactive protein are seen with IgE-mediated reactions.
   - Beta lactams, Quinolones, Platinum based chemo, chimeric antibodies, and neuromuscular blocking agents are frequently indicated
* **Type II** – Delayed in onset and caused by antibody (usually IgG) mediated cell destruction. There are rare in the context of drug reactions and present as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia several days after exposure.
   - NSAIDs, penecillins, cephalosporins, heparin, PTU, and some other drugs may cause this reaction.
* **Type III** – Delayed in onset and caused by IgG:drug immune complex deposition and complement activation. Rare in context of drug reactions and present after high-dose, prolonged administrations. Can take form of serum sickness, vasculitis, or arthus reactions. Can ersult from antitoxins, some vaccines, and in the case of vasculitis, penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, and allopurinol.
* **Type IV** – Delayed in onset and T cell mediated. Of note, this classification was established before a detailed analysis of T cell subsets and functions was technically possible. As new immunologic tools were developed, type IV reactions were further subdivided into types IVa, IVb, IVc, and IVd.
   - Typically occur 2-3d following administrations and sometimes weeks later. SJS/TEN and DRESS/DiHS (both very dangerous) are type IV reactions and often occur after weeks of uncomplicated treatment.
   - **Contact dermatitis**: topical drug reactino with erythema and edema with vesicles/bullae that rupture and crust.
   - **Macropapular (mobilliform)**: very common. Importantly, this spares the mucous membranes and internal organs. Symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE; formerly called "baboon syndrome") is an uncommon form of drug eruption, most often induced by antibiotics. Not extremely concerning and treating through the reaction is possible with necessary, potentially using corticosteroids to limit exanthemous progression.
   - **SDRIFE**: v-shaped erythema in gluteal/perianal and other flexural areas.
   - **Drug Fever**: usually accompanied by nonurticarial rash. Caused by azathioprine, sulfasalazine, minocycline, **TMP-SMX**, siroliums, and tacrolimus.
   - **SJS/TEN**: discussed in detail below.
   - **Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS/DRESS)**: severe rash, fever, and multiorgan failure often with peripheral eosinophilia and atypical activated CD8+ lymphocytes. Associated with antiepileptics, minocycline, allopurinol, dapsone, abacavir, and nevirapine.

Medications cause types I and IV reactions far more commonly than types II and III, which usually follow prolonged, higher dose therapy. Most medications cause just one type, although certain drugs, such as penicillin, can induce all four types.

### HLA Associations [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-hypersensitivity-classification-and-clinical-features)

* DiHS/DRESS and SJS/TEN to allopurinol is associated with HLA-B*58:01. This B*58:01 association is less stringent in Caucasians (approximately 60 percent), in whom other alleles are also involved in SJS/TEN due to allopurinol.
* DiHS/DRESS, and in some cases SJS/TEN, to carbamazepine disproportionately affects several groups.
   * Han Chinese patients with HLA-B15:02, as well as Thai, Malaysian, and Indian patients with this same allele.
   * Japanese and European patients with HLA-A*31:01.
* DiHS/DRESS to abacavir occur exclusively in patients with HLA-B*57:01; milder reactions to this drug are not associated with a certain HLA-allele.
* Dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome disproportionately affects Chinese patients with HLA-B*13:01.

#### Other Reactions
* Fixed drug reactions - Fixed drug eruption is a relatively common reaction, which is characterized by erythematous and edematous plaques with a grayish center or frank bullae. Lesions recur at exactly the same sites (typically lips and tongue, genitalia, face, and acral areas) with drug re-exposure (picture 12 and picture 13). These site(s) develop postinflammatory pigmentation. Fixed drug eruption can occur in response to sulfonamides, anticoagulants, and many other drugs. The mechanism is unknown, although T cells residing in the skin produce interferon gamma
* Drug-induced urticaria - Drug-induced urticaria is seen in 0.16% of medical inpatients and accounts for 9% of chronic urticaria or angioedema seen in dermatology outpatient departments. Occurring within 24 hours of drug ingestion, it is most commonly caused by penicillins, sulfonamides and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Drug-induced urticaria is seen in association with anaphylaxis, angioedema, and serum sickness. For mild reactions, avoidance of the causative drug and treatment with antihistamines will suffice. For anaphylactic shock, treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline), corticosteroids and antihistamines is required. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11705092/.)


# Toxic Drug Reactions

Steven Johnson Sydrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) represent a spectrum of severe adverse drug reaction. Their diagnosis and treatment is summarized alongside other emergent dermatologic conditions in the table below: [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2010/1001/p773.html)

![Derm Emergent](/img/Derm_emergenvies.gif)


## SJS/TEN

Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are acute hypersensitivity cutaneous reactions that present as dermatologic emergencies. They are thought to be severe presentations of erythema multiforme. By definition, Stevens-Johnson syndrome affects less than 10 percent of the body surface area, toxic epidermal necrolysis affects more than 30 percent of the body surface area, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis involves 15 to 30 percent of the body surface area. 

Approximately 50 percent of cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 80 to 90 percent of cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis are drug induced. Common causative agents include sulfa drugs, antiepileptic drugs, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is much more likley to occur in people with HIV.

### Implicated drugs

* Anticonvulsants: lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone
* Allopurinol, especially in doses of more than 100 mg per day
* Sulfonamides: cotrimoxazole, sulfasalazine
* Antibiotics: penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, minocycline
* Paracetamol/acetaminophen
* Nevirapine (non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor)
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (oxicam type mainly)
* Contrast media

#### HLA risk factor

* Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, and South Indian people if they carry HLA-B*1502 and take aromatic anticonvulsants.
* Han Chinese if they carry HLA-B*5801 and take allopurinol
* Europeans if they carry HLA-B*5701 and take abacavir, or if they carry HLA-A*3101 and take carbamazepine.

### Presentation

After one to three weeks of exposure to the causative agent, a prodrome of fever, malaise, headache, cough, and conjunctivitis develops. Skin lesions appear 1-3d later and develop from erythematous macules with dark purpuric centers that develop into bullae and flaccid blisters with full thickness epidermal necrosis. More severe cases include skin sloughing. Unlike milder erythmatous reactions, there is almost always mucosal involvment. 

### Complications

Complications include hypotension, renal failure, corneal ulcerations, anterior uveitis, erosive vulvovaginitis or balanitis, respiratory failure, seizures, and coma. The most common sequelae are ocular scarring and blindness.

SCORTEN risk criteria can predict mortality (especially serum bicarb which is associated with 40x odds of death)

* Age  older than 40 years
* Presence of a malignancy
* Heart rate of more than 120 bpm
* Initial percentage of epidermal detachment greater than 10%
* Serum urea level greater than 10 mmol/L
* Serum glucose level greater than 14 mmol/L
* Serum bicarbonate level less than 20 mmol/L

A SCORTEN ranges with their associated mortality (in %) are as follows: score 0-1 (3.2%), score 2 (12.1%), score 3 (35.3%), score 4 (58.3%), and score 5 (>90%) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459323/)

### Treatment

Patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis should be admitted to an intensive care or burn unit immediately, because rapid deterioration is possible. The causative drug and any unnecessary medications should be discontinued. Aggressive management should include fluid resuscitation, nutritional supplementation, and wound care. Antibiotics should be used only if there is evidence of infection. Intravenous immune globulin has been incorporated into some treatment protocols. An ophthalmology consultation is necessary to assess for associated ocular sequelae.
   - **Corticosteriods?**: treatment of SJS with corticosteroids may be associated with significant side effects and prolonged recovery. Specifically, the a 1976 study and several following articles indicated that patients receiving systemic corticosteroids (compared to supportive care) had a longer hospital stay and more complications than those who were not treated with corticosteroids. However, proponents argue that these findings are due to a delay in administration. Noteably, prospective studies have shown that corticosteroid use is associated with improved outcome without increase in complications. Early therapy with systemic prednisone (0.5 to 1.0mg/kg/day) or pulse methylprednisolone (1mg/kg/day for 3 days) has been shown to be effective in preserving epidermal tissue. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2923952/)
   - **Other therapies**: The results of several meta-analyses suggest a potential benefit for cyclosporine, etanercept, and IVIG + corticosteroids. However, there are no established pharmacologic treatments.

## Derm Vocaublary

1. Bolus: A rounded mass or lump, often used to describe a localized collection of substances, such as medication or contrast material.
2. Blister: A raised area of the skin filled with clear fluid (serum) or blood, resulting from damage to the skin's outer layers.
3. Papule: A small, solid, elevated lesion on the skin that is usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It may be palpable (able to be felt) and often represents a localized cellular reaction.
4. Erythematous: Refers to redness of the skin, typically due to dilation of superficial blood vessels. It is a common sign of inflammation.
5. Bullae: Large, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, typically measuring more than 1 centimeter in diameter. They can result from various causes, including burns or certain skin conditions.
6. Nikolsky Sign: A dermatological examination technique where slight rubbing or pressure on the skin causes the outer layer to separate from the underlying skin. It is seen in certain blistering disorders, indicating skin fragility.
7. Induration: An abnormally firm or hard feeling in the skin, often due to localized inflammation or tissue proliferation. It is commonly assessed by palpation.
8. Exudate: Fluid, such as pus or serum, that oozes out from blood vessels or damaged tissue. It is often seen in areas of inflammation or infection.
9. Full Thickness Necrosis: Complete cell death across all layers of a tissue or organ. It is a severe form of tissue damage that can occur due to various causes, including ischemia or infections.


# Pharmacology

* Acetaminophen - severe reactions are rare. 
* Bactrim (TMP-SMX) - Implicated in type IV drug hypersensitivity reactions, espcially with drug fever. 
* Allopurinol - Implicated in type III and IV drug hypersenstivitiy reactions. Doses >100mg/day highly associated with SJS/TEN. Reactions to allopurinol are especially common in individals with the HLA-B*58:01 allele.
   - Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a urate-lowering medication that is FDA approved for managing gout, preventing tumor lysis syndrome, and preventing recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis in patients with hyperuricosuria. It reduces levels of serum urate and is indicated with frequent (2+ per year) attacks, CKD2 or greater, tophi on imaging, and history of nephrolithiasis. 
   - Inhibition of xanthine oxidase interrups the purine catabolism pathway, preventing conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid. 
   - Allopurinol is associated with hepatotoxicity along with the hypersensitivity mentioned above. The highest risk of hypersensitivity is in the first few months of therapy, especially with higher starting doses of allopurinol. Concurrent diuretics, especially thiazide use, renal insufficiency stage 3, or higher, are major risk factors. Patients of Korean, Han Chinese, and Thai descent with HLA-B*5801 genotype are at a very high risk of AHS. 
* Losartan - ARB antihypertensive. Not indicated in severe reactions, with very rare type I hypersensitivity.
* Penicillin - Implicated in all types of drug hypersensitivity. A meta-analysis of 38 studies including 2917 patients demonstrated that the proportion of antibiotics associated with SJS/TEN worldwide was 28%. Among antibiotic-associated SJS/TEN, the sulfonamide class was associated with 32% of cases, followed by penicillins (22%), cephalosporins (11%), fluoroquinolones (4%), and macrolides (2%) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9932945/)

### Case Specifics

#### Cultural Communication - [The Oakland Study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24787)

A 2018 systematic review found worse communication in the domains of observed communication quality, information-giving, and participatory decision-making in non-concordant physician/patient race. Findings are somewhat more mixed for patient reported measures of communication quality; satisfaction; partnership building; positive talk; negative talk; length of visit; and talk time ratio. 

#### Adressing risks and benefits [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC200818/)

Strategies to communcate effectivley include:
1. Avoid using only descriptive terms (i.e. "Low risk")
2. Use consistent denominator
3. Offer positive and negative outcomes, emphasize presenting odds in a positive manner when patient attitue is especially important
4. Use absolute numbers rather than relative risks when possible
5. Use visual aids for probabilities

#### Learning from adverse outcomes [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369881/)

![Adverse](/img/adverse_events_advice.jpg)

#### Gout

Gout is one of the most common causes of chronic inflammatory arthritis in the United States, characterized by monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals deposition in the tissues. It is highly associated with genetic and dietary risk factors. Manifestations include.
* Acute gout flare (recurrent flares of inflammatory arthritis)
* Chronic gouty arthropathy
* Accumulation of urate crystals in the form of tophaceous deposits
* Uric acid nephrolithiasis
* Chronic nephropathy
