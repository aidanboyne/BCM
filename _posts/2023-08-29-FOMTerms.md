   - **Function**: Fills spaces between organs, provides cushioning.

2. **Dense Regular Connective Tissue**
   - **Components**: Fibroblasts, densely packed collagen fibers.
   - **Function**: Provides strength in one direction (e.g., tendons, ligaments).

3. **Dense Irregular Connective Tissue**

## Epithelial Tissues

1. **Simple Squamous Epithelium**

   - **Function**: Allows for stretching (e.g., bladder).


# 1.4

1. **Epinephrine (Adrenaline): hormone**
    - Produced by: Adrenal medulla
    - Actions: Activates both α and β adrenergic receptors. It increases heart rate, force of contraction, and cardiac output (β1 effects), induces bronchodilation (β2 effects), and also has vasoconstrictive effects especially at high doses (α effects) due to preferential binding to β receptor being overwhelmed with greater α number on blood vessels.
    - Uses: Anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, croup, local hemostasis (when combined with local anesthetics).

2. **Isoproterenol**
    - Produced synthetically.
    - Actions: It's a non-selective β-adrenergic agonist. Increases heart rate and force of contraction (β1 effects) and causes bronchodilation (β2 effects).
    - Uses: Was once used for asthma and bradycardia, but there are safer alternatives now. Rarely used in modern medicine due to the potential for causing arrhythmias.

3. **Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline): Neurotransmitter**
    - Produced by: Locus coeruleus in the brain and postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings.
    - Actions: Primarily α-adrenergic receptor agonist with some β1 effects. Causes vasoconstriction, increasing systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.
    - Uses: Septic shock and other forms of shock to raise blood pressure.

4. **Dopamine**
    - Produced by: Several areas of the brain, including the substantia nigra.
    - Actions: At low doses, it stimulates dopamine receptors causing vasodilation in renal and splanchnic circulation. At moderate doses, it stimulates β1 receptors increasing heart contractility and output. At high doses, it has α effects causing vasoconstriction.
    - Uses: Shock, especially when renal perfusion needs support, and heart failure.

5. **Dobutamine**
    - Produced synthetically.
    - Actions: Primarily a β1-adrenergic agonist. Increases the force of heart muscle contraction and, to a lesser degree, heart rate, leading to increased cardiac output.
    - Uses: Heart failure (especially in acute decompensated cases), cardiac stress testing.

6. **Phenylephrine**
    - Produced synthetically.
    - Actions: Selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist. Causes vasoconstriction.
    - Uses: Nasal congestion (as a nasal spray), raising blood pressure (intravenous), pupil dilation during ophthalmic procedures, and as a spinal anesthetic adjunct.

# Week 1 Wednesday Notes

### Pearls
 - Humans cannot make unsaturated Fatty Acids
 - Lysosomes recycle cellular contents (i.e. glycogen)
 - Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) can occur due to translocation between c9-c22 leading to abnormal "Philadelphia" chromosome 22 that creates an unregulated kinase. This kinase (BCR-ABL) is blocked by imatinib (Gleevec), an oral drug.
 - ATP only **2** high energy bonds (beta/gamma, alpha/beta phosphate anhydride bonds). Last bond between ester and alpha phosphate is low energy ester bond.

#### Bond Types
1. Amino acids: peptide bond
2. Glucose polymer: glycosidic bond
3. glycerol+FA: ester bond
4. DNA sugars: phosphodiester bond

#### Some drugs
 - AZT: synthetic neucleotide mimicing thymidine with N3 replacing OH group
 - Cifloflaxin
   - inhibits bacterial gyrase (bacterial analouge of topoisomerase II)
   - In class of fluoroquinolones

Certainly! Here's a concise summary of the **replisome** formatted in markdown:

### Replisome

The **replisome** is a complex molecular machinery responsible for **DNA replication** in cells. Its main components and functions include:

- **DNA Helicase**: This enzyme unwinds the double-stranded DNA, creating single strands to be used as templates.
- **Single-Strand Binding Proteins (SSBPs)**: These bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent them from re-annealing and protect them from degradation.
- **Primase**: Generates short RNA primers that provide a starting point for DNA synthesis.
- **DNA Polymerase**: An enzyme that extends the growing DNA chain by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand. There are different types for leading and lagging strand synthesis:
  - **Leading Strand**: Continuous synthesis in the direction of replication fork movement.
  - **Lagging Strand**: Discontinuous synthesis in the form of **Okazaki fragments**.
- **Topoisomerase**: Relieves tension in the DNA strand by cutting one (topoisomerase I - ATP independent) or both (topoisomerase II - ATP dependent) strands to allow DNA to unwind. Note 
- **DNA Ligase**: Connects the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand to produce a continuous DNA molecule.

Most common Africa/Mediterranean coast genetic disease: sickle cell
 - Glutamic acid --> Valine: Hemoglobin confirmation changes (hydrophilic --> hydrophobic)
 - Treated with hydroxyurea (not too great but ok) which increases fetal hemeoglobin synthesis.
Most common Caucasian genetic disease: CF

Insulin chains held together by disulfide bonds catylized by protein disulfide isomerase.
Eukaryotes have proteins starting with Methionine, prokaryotes start with formylmethinonine (recognized by immune system).

ADD TYPES OF PLASIA


## Motivational Interviewing (MI)
 - Increase healthy behaviors: exercise, diet, medication adherence
 - Decrease unhealthy behaviours: substance abuse
 - Goal directed collaborative conversation to strengthen one's own motivation and get people to raise response
 - Increases retention and engagement, more effective than direct confrontation (5%), empowers without excusing
 - Feels good for physician: avoids abandonment and frustration
 - Useful anytime we need behavior change i.e. raise ambivalence, resolve ambivalence, increase confidence, and solidify new behavior

Change theory: 
 - Paradox of change: accept person for who they are and whay they do - allows them freedom to consider change rather than defending themselves
 - Michelangelo: People have personal expertise and wisdom and tend to develop positvley given proper conditions and support

Compassion
Curiosity
Change talk

Four principles:
1. Express Empathy
2. Develop Discrepancy
3. Roll with Resistance
4. Support Self-Efficacy

Foundational Skills:
OARS: Open ended questions, Affirmations, Reflections, Summaries

SBIRT: Screening, Breif Intervention, Refferal to Treatment

- What do you like not like, summarize with pt terminology
- Readiness ruler: so where does that leave you on scale of 0-10 0=not at all ready 10=ready today
	- 0-3: Elicit pt percived negative consequences, express concern & link to current visit if possible, offer info, support and follow up
	- 4-7: Explore motivation to change (why 4-7 not 2-3?, what would take to go 8-9), when u are ready what would that look like
	- 8-10: Affirm readiness, help develop plan and access resources

Elicit-Provide-Elicit
 - What pt knows and wants to know
 - Affirm and give targeted info
 - Get pt perception and understanding
