# Sleep medicine

## Sleep
- Period of rest with decreased awareness from external stimuli which is rapidly reversible
- Lack of light at night causes SCN to stop inhibiting melatonin produciton by pineal gland
- Two process wake cycle: sleep drive vs circadian alerting signal (SCN)
- Measure via EEG: non-rem and rem. Look at Beta, alpha (awake), delta (N3), theta (N1), gamma waves. Cycle through the below every 90-120 minutes. 
	- N1, N2, N3 (slow HR, BP), REM (fluctuating HR, BP)
	- N1 and N2 (sleep spindle, K-complex) light sleep
	- N3 deep sleep
	- REM is vivid dreaming. Muscle atonia except eye, diaphragm, intercostals.
	- NREM 75-80%, REM 20-25%
	- Polysomnography (brain, nasal cannula, microphone, breathing belt, limb electrodes)
		- EEG, EOG, EMG, EKG, Airflow, respiratory belt, Pulse ox, limb leads

## Apnea

- Apnea: no breathing >= 10s
	- Obstructive, mixed, central
	- Obstructive (BMI>30, anatomical differences such as small/receeding jaw, septum deviation, large tounge, soft palate/uvula enlargement, epiglottis enlargement)
	- Apnea hypopnea index (>= 5 is abnormal)
	- <15 mild, >30 severe
	- Treat with over 15 or symptomatic
	- Risk for older males, obese, orofacial deformities, genetics. Sleepiness, morning headache, irratibility, etc. Tounge fissures, high arched palate, narrow lateral area, persistent tonsils
	- STOP BANG (snore, tired, observed stopped breathing, high BP, BMI > 35, Age > 50, Nieck circumfrence > 40cm, gender Male)


-OSA sleep study pretty good but lest complete
- Adverse consequences include increased HR, BP, low O2 --> inflammation --> way more likley HTN (drug resistance!), MI, Stroke, Arrythmia. Poor mood/relationships also. Higher risk of motor accidents

- Treat with weight losss, avoid alcohol, avoid supine sleeping
	- CPAP, BiPAP, or dental appliance
	- Surgical via UPPP, tonsillectomy (esp in children), tracheostomy (not done any more), and Bariaric surgurey for weight loss
	- New glossylpharengyl stim device

### Central

Central: no stimulus to breathe, seen in CHF or with CNS diseases
- Characterisitc Cheyne Strokes breahting (cyclical drive, seen often in CHF)
- Get stopping of all neural impulse to breathe on sleep study

Treat via hitting primary pathology, CPAP... Severe may need nocturnal mechanical ventilatory assistance
REMEDE: stimulates phrenic nerve --> corrects central apnea via diaphragm

### Other sleep disorders
SLeep related movement disorder: leg (restless, periodic movements), bruxism, hypnic jerks. Restless leg related to brain iron deficiency (pregnancy, chronic renal failure, reglan, antipsychotics, antidepressants)

Most important for test: how to differentiate OSA and Central SA
