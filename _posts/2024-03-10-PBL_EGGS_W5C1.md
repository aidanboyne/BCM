## The Trimesters

![Development Defects](/img/Development_defects.png)

Size can be estimated with fruits: 6- to 8-week size = small pear, 8- to 10-week size = orange, 10- to 12-week size = grapefruit

### First Trimester

Checkups **q 4 weeks**

Week...
- 1 hCG secretion from blastocyst which implants around day 6
- 2 Bilaminar (epiblast, hypoblast) disk
- 3 Trilaminar disk via gastrulation (endo, meso, ectoderm). Notochord arises from midline mesoderm and forms neural plate --> neural tube via SHH
- 4 Heart begins to form, limb buds form
- 8 Genitalia have male/female morphology

Patients should recive CBC. Women at risk should be screened for hemoglobinopathy, TB, blood type and Rh, Hep B surface antiven, HIV, bacterial vaginosis, TSH, and varicella. Older women (>35y.o.) with history of vhildren with genetic disorders should consider genetic screen.

Complications include hyperemisis, constipation, fatigue, dizziness, and emotional stress.

### Second Trimester

Checkups **q 4 weeks**

Women should be evaluated between 16-20 weeks with US for fetal anatomy and dating. Genetic screening can be offered. Counceling concerning heartburn, skin changes, bleeding gums/nose, breastfeeding, etc. Women at risk for preeclampsia should be given low dose aspirin after 12w.

### Thrid Trimester

Checkups **q 2 weeks** until 36 weeks, then **q 1 week**

Nausea, vominitng, crmaping, contractions, bleeds, headache, back pain, vaginal discharge, swelling, weight gain, urinary symptoms, etc. should be asked at each visit. Diabetes screening should be preformed from w24-28. Group B strep screen at 35-37w.  Women with negative blood type should get RhoIgG in third trimester. 

Counceling about how to distinguish between general discomfort and preterm labor, preeclampsia, and other concerning conditions is needed. Planning for childbirth, breastfeeding, and management of expections should be preformed. 

Labor should be inducted at 41 weeks if nautral labor is not reached. 

## Bleeding during Pregnancy

### < 20 Weeks

- Ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out with ultrasound. 
- Spontaneous abortion must also be ruled out and is likley if clots, tissue or large amounts of blood are passed or if there is significant pelvic pain/cramping.
- Visualization of the internal cervical os during the first trimester is concerning for loss of pregnancy. Dilated interal os with painful cramps suggests loss in second trimester.
- Lesions of the cervix or vagina can lead to bleeds
- Trophoblastic diseases such as hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma are possible causes of bleed. 

### > 20 Weeks

- Heavy bleeding with contractions and abdominal pain:
    - Placental Abruption: premature separation of a normally implanted placenta prior to birth. Risk factors include prior abruption, trauma, tobacco use, cocaine use, methamphetamine use, hypertension, and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
    - Placenta Previa: Implantation near or over cervix.
    - Uterine Rupture: Prior cesarean birth or transmyometrial surgery can result in complete disruption of all uterine layers. 
- Light bleeds with no abdominal pain:
    - Cervical insufficiency: clinical diagnosis based on vervical dilation and effacement in the second trimester exposing the fetal membrane. 
    - Cervical or vaginal lesions : includes lacerations, neoplasms, infection, polyps, and fibroids. 
    - Some spotting (aka "Bloody Show") is normal when preceeding labor by less than 72 hours.

### Teratogens

| Teratogen | Effect on Fetus |
| --- | --- |
| **Medications** | |
| ACE inhibitors | Renal failure, oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria. |
| Alkylating agents | Multiple anomalies (eg, ear/facial abnormalities, absence of digits). |
| Aminoglycosides | Ototoxicity. "A mean guy hit the baby in the ear." |
| Antiepileptic drugs | Neural tube defects, cardiac defects, cleft palate, skeletal abnormalities (eg, phalanx/nail hypoplasia, facial dysmorphism). Most commonly due to valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital; high-dose folate supplementation recommended. |
| Diethylstilbestrol | Vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma, congenital Müllerian anomalies. |
| Fluoroquinolones | Cartilage damage. |
| Folate antagonists | Neural tube defects. Most commonly due to trimethoprim, methotrexate. |
| Isotretinoin | Craniofacial (eg, microtia, dysmorphism), CNS, cardiac, and thymic defects. Contraception mandatory. Pronounce "isoteratinoin" for its teratogenicity. |
| Lithium | Ebstein anomaly. |
| Methimazole | Aplasia cutis congenita (congenital absence of skin, typically on scalp). |
| Tetracyclines | Discolored teeth, inhibited bone growth. Pronounce "teethracyclines." |
| Thalidomide | Limb defects (eg, phocomelia—flipperlike limbs). Pronounce "thalimbdomide." |
| Warfarin | Bone and cartilage deformities (stippled epiphyses, nasal and limb hypoplasia), optic nerve atrophy, cerebral hemorrhage. Use heparin during pregnancy (does not cross placenta). |
| **Substance use** | |
| Alcohol | Fetal alcohol syndrome. |
| Cocaine | Preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (FGR). Cocaine → vasoconstriction. |
| Tobacco smoking | Preterm birth, low birth weight (leading cause in resource-rich countries), FGR, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ADHD. Nicotine → vasoconstriction, CO → impaired O2 delivery. |
| **Other** | |
| Iodine lack or excess | Congenital hypothyroidism. |
| Maternal diabetes | Caudal regression syndrome, cardiac defects (eg, transposition of great arteries, VSD), neural tube defects, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia (due to islet cell hyperplasia), polyhydramnios. |
| Maternal PKU | Fetal growth restriction, microcephaly, intellectual disability, congenital heart defects. |
| Methylmercury | Neurotoxicity. Watchout for predator fish |
| X-rays | Microcephaly, intellectual disability. Effects minimized by use of lead shielding.  |

# Preeclampsia [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-023-00417-6)

Preeclampsia is a multisystem progressive disorder characterized by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria or the new onset of hypertension plus significant end-organ dysfunction with or without proteinuria, typically presenting after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum. Abnormal remodeling of the spiral arteries (late in the first trimester and completed by 18-20w) due to failure to penetrate mymetrial segment causes tortous vacscular channels causing relativley hypoxic trophoblastic tissue. This stress on the syncytiotrophoblasts manifests as oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis which releases pro-inflammatory substances into maternal circulation. 

HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) appears to be a subtype of preeclampsia with severe features in which hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia are the predominant features. Hypertension, central nervous system dysfunction, and/or renal dysfunction may also be present. The majority of patients, but not all, have hypertension (82 to 88 percent, although in some cases the increase in blood pressure may be subtle initially) and/or proteinuria (86 to 100 percent).

### Risk factors

Women with previous episodes of preeclampsia, pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertention, CKD, multifetal pregnancy, nulliparity, family history of preeclampsia, age greater than 35 or below 20, low calcium intake, high body mass index, and in vitro fertilization have higher risk. Oddly, smoking may be protective. Overall, about 4.6% of all pregnancies are complicated by preeclampsia. Late-onset (on or after 34 weeks) is more common. 

### Presentation

Approximately 25 percent of patients with preeclampsia develop severe hypertension (systolic pressure ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥110 mmHg) and/or one or more of the following nonspecific symptoms, which characterize the severe end of the disease spectrum. Severe hypertension and/or alarm symptoms signify the need for urgent evaluation, prompt treatment to reduce blood pressure below the severe level, and possibly delivery by induction or cesarean birth (see 'Patient evaluation' below):

- Persistent and/or severe headache
- Visual abnormalities (scotomata, photophobia, blurred vision, or temporary blindness [rare])
- Upper abdominal, retrosternal, or epigastric pain (*may be presenting symptom!*)
- Altered mental status (confusion, altered behavior [agitation])
- New dyspnea, orthopnea

Development of seizure upstages the diagnosis to eclampsia. Histopathologic correlates include cerebral hemorrhage, petechiae, edema, ischemic damage, fibrinoid necrosis, etc... Pulmonary edema, placental abruption, and liver rupture are other potentially deadly associated conditions.

Long-term effects of pre-eclampsia on the child’s health are mainly caused by FGR and medically indicated preterm birth.

### Evaluation

CBC, creatinine, LFTs, and uinary protein should be taken in all patients. Fetal status should be evaluated with ultrasound biophysical profile.

### HELLP

Severe complication of pre-eclampsia characterized by haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (lactate dehydrogenase ≥600 IU/l; aspartate aminotransferase >70 IU/l; platelet count <150,000 cells/µl). The most common symptoms in affected patients are right-upper quadrant pain, epigastralgia, nausea and vomiting, headache and visual changes. In hyperbilirubinaemia, indirect bilirubin predominates; thus, only in advanced cases can the patient present clinical jaundice.

### Treatment

![Preeclampsia Treatments](/img/preeclamps_treat.webp)

The initial management in patients with eclampsia should be the use of measures for clinical stabilization of critically ill patients (fasting, oxygenation, tongue protection with Guedel cannula, venous access, bed with raised guardrails and in a semi-sitting position). The patient should preferably be kept in a calm environment but under intense monitoring. MgSO4 is used worldwide as an anticonvulsant to stop and prevent seizures. However, due to its increased risk of caesarean delivery and maternal adverse effects, intense clinical monitoring is required. It is reasonable to restrict the use of MgSO4 to patients who have presented with eclampsia or ‘severe’ pre-eclampsia as defined by the Magpie trial (160/110 mmHg, 3 + proteinuria) or a slightly lower threshold (150/100 mmHg, 2 + proteinuria) if accompanied by two or more signs of imminent eclampsia (headache, visual symptoms, clonus). Medication administration schedules and clinical signs of magnesium intoxication should be monitored. Delivery is generally indicated when eclampsia is present, especially if the gestational age is above viability in the given clinical care setting. If gestational viability is not yet reached, expectant monitoring can be used in cases close to viability, provided there is rigorous monitoring

# Gestational Diabetes [[ref]](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2018/02000/acog_practice_bulletin_no__190__gestational.37.aspx)

Defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy. Women with high body mass, low activity, relatives with diabetes, PCOS, low HDL or with pre-diabetes are more likley to develop gestational diabetes. The disease is caused by human placental lactogen release by the placenta during pregnancy. The hormone is similar to growth hormone and alters the insulin receptor and pathway to maintain high clucose levels for the placenta via upregulation of lypolysis and gluconeogenesis. Screening is reccomended at 24-28 weeks with a 50g 1-hour oral glucose challenge and is confimed with a 3-hour 100g challenge.

### Treatment

Nonpharmacologic interventions such as a tailored diet and increased exercise are reccomended for initial treatment. If glucose remains elevated despite optimal adherence, insulin therapy should be initiated. Metformin and glyburide are often used as well, but lack FDA approval.

## Pharmacology

- **Magnesium Sulfate**: CNS depressant by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. It also acts as a vasodilator by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels. It is first-line for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.
- **Labetalol**: non-selective beta-blocker with additional alpha-1 adrenergic blocking activity. This causes a decrease in heart rate, CO, and PVR without reflex tachycardia. It is first line for hypertension management in eclampsia.
- **Midazolam**: short-acting benzodiazepine that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA receptors in the CNS, enhancing GABA inhibition and resulting in acute sedative and anti-convulsant effects.
