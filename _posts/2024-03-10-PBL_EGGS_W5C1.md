## The Trimesters

### First Trimester

Week...
1. hCG secretion from blastocyst which implants around day 6
2. Bilaminar (epiblast, hypoblast) disk
3. Trilaminar disk via gastrulation (endo, meso, ectoderm). Notochord arises from midline mesoderm and forms neural plate --> neural tube via SHH
4. Heart begins to form, limb buds form
8. Genitalia have male/female morphology

### Second Trimester

### Thrid Trimester

### Delivery

### Teratogens

| Teratogen | Effect on Fetus |
| --- | --- |
| **Medications** | |
| ACE inhibitors | Renal failure, oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria. |
| Alkylating agents | Multiple anomalies (eg, ear/facial abnormalities, absence of digits). |
| Aminoglycosides | Ototoxicity. "A mean guy hit the baby in the ear." |
| Antiepileptic drugs | Neural tube defects, cardiac defects, cleft palate, skeletal abnormalities (eg, phalanx/nail hypoplasia, facial dysmorphism). Most commonly due to valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital; high-dose folate supplementation recommended. |
| Diethylstilbestrol | Vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma, congenital Müllerian anomalies. |
| Fluoroquinolones | Cartilage damage. |
| Folate antagonists | Neural tube defects. Most commonly due to trimethoprim, methotrexate. |
| Isotretinoin | Craniofacial (eg, microtia, dysmorphism), CNS, cardiac, and thymic defects. Contraception mandatory. Pronounce "isoteratinoin" for its teratogenicity. |
| Lithium | Ebstein anomaly. |
| Methimazole | Aplasia cutis congenita (congenital absence of skin, typically on scalp). |
| Tetracyclines | Discolored teeth, inhibited bone growth. Pronounce "teethracyclines." |
| Thalidomide | Limb defects (eg, phocomelia—flipperlike limbs). Pronounce "thalimbdomide." |
| Warfarin | Bone and cartilage deformities (stippled epiphyses, nasal and limb hypoplasia), optic nerve atrophy, cerebral hemorrhage. Use heparin during pregnancy (does not cross placenta). |
| **Substance use** | |
| Alcohol | Fetal alcohol syndrome. |
| Cocaine | Preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (FGR). Cocaine → vasoconstriction. |
| Tobacco smoking | Preterm birth, low birth weight (leading cause in resource-rich countries), FGR, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ADHD. Nicotine → vasoconstriction, CO → impaired O2 delivery. |
| **Other** | |
| Iodine lack or excess | Congenital hypothyroidism. |
| Maternal diabetes | Caudal regression syndrome, cardiac defects (eg, transposition of great arteries, VSD), neural tube defects, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia (due to islet cell hyperplasia), polyhydramnios. |
| Maternal PKU | Fetal growth restriction, microcephaly, intellectual disability, congenital heart defects. |
| Methylmercury | Neurotoxicity. Watchout for predator fish |
| X-rays | Microcephaly, intellectual disability. Effects minimized by use of lead shielding.  |
