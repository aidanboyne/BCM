# Week 2 Tuesday Notes

FOR TEST: focus mostly on viral response

Physical barriers
 - Structural
 - Chemical
 - Microbiological


* Monocytes (reneform nucleus) leave vasculature into tissues and differentiate into macrophages
* Innate lymphoid cells act like innate T-cells
* TLR found on Macrophage and NK cell. Some found only in endosomes (3,7,8,9) others on surface (1,2,4,5,6)
* Viral infection upregulates TNFa and B type 1
* ALmost all immune cells are hanging out under the skin and in gut mucosa.
* Neutrophil, Macrophage, and Dendritic cells are phagocytotic. 
* Specific adaptive cells are B and T cells
* Granulocytes: Neutrophil, Basophil, Eosinophil, Mast Cell, NK Cell, platelets
* Lymphocytes: B, T, NK cells, Innate Lymphoid cells
* Professional APC: Macrophage, Dendritic, B-cells

#### Lymphoid Organs
* Primary(central) lymphoid organs: Bone-marrow (clavicle, backbone, pelvis) and thymus (much bigger in pediatric, replaced mostly by fat in adults)
* Secondary(peripheral) lymphoid organs: Lymph nodes, Spleen, Peyer's patch (all have distinct areas for T and B cells)

Lymphocytes are naive until they bind to cognate antigen (antigen they can bind to stablely)
Inflammation brings in immune cells and creates hostile environment for pathogens. Inflammation mediated primarily by macrophage.
Extravasation and diakenesis describe movement of neutrophil and other immune cells.

IgM is initial Ab (with relativley low affinity) that starts B-cell mediated immunity

T-helper cells aid in activation of other cells
Cytotoxic T-cells kill cells with cognate antigen presentation
B-cells mediate humoral immunity. They are activated by microbe and then clonally expands with help of helper T-cell. Few then stay as IgM and most start with IgG which gets better binding over time with affinity maturation.

Both B and T cells undergo clonal selection in response to antigen recognition. T-cells only recognize antigen _fragments_ while B-cells recognize _intact_ antigens.

Professional APCs have **costimulatory** signals upon binding


MHCI and II look like moose heads. They are unstable without something in peptide binding groove (i.e. antigen)
 - MHCI beta-2 domain binds CD8 coreceptor. They present endogenous antigen to CD8 cytotoxic cells
	- Expressed by all cells except RBC
 - MHCII alpha-3 binds CD4 coreceptor. They present exogenous antigen to CD4 T-helper cells
	- Expressed only by B, Macrophage, and dendritic cells (and thymic epithelium)
	- Invariant chain binds peptides in ER and then is cleaved leaving CLIP behind in vesicle


* Skin or respiratory pathogens presented in lymph nodes (MALT)
* Blood pathogens presented in spleen. 
* Gut pathogens are presented in mesenteric lymph nodes (GALT)

## Immune response to Viral Pathogens
Immunocompromised patients are prone to developing oppurtunistic infection from normally benign organisms.

### Diagnostic Testing:
 - Don't need culture for every infection, only when specific organism would change how we treat or narrow differential dx
 - Diagnostic imaging must be weighed by cost and radiation
 - Kidney liver function needed for Abx dosing
 - Clinical syndromes can indicate testing for isolation purposes
 - With CBC we usually see higher neutrophil counts in bacterial infection.

### ID testing:
 - Amplified: culture and NAAT (PCR)
 - Unamplified: microscopy, serology, antigen detection

### Test stats:
Sensitivity: how many true positives show positive
Specificity: how many true negatives show negative

Positive predicted value: proportion of subjects with + test who are actually positive
Negative predictive valueL proportion of subjects with - test who are actually negative

Ideal sputum culture (want from LRT not URT):
 - Abundant leukocytes
 - < 10 squamous epithelial cells
 - Numerous bacteria of single morphotype

# Week 2 Wednesday Notes

## Cell Death, Inflammation, and Tissue Repair

Main death
 - Apoptosis
 - Necrosis
 - Other: Necroptosis, Pyroptosis, Autophagy

If cell cannot adapt to stress or has injurous stimuli --> cell injury.

Injury:
 - Hypoxia: reduced oxygenation or O2 carrying capacity
 - Physical Agents
 - Chemical Agents: drugs, electrolyte imbalances
 - Infections
 - Immunologic
 - Genetic Abnormalities
 - Nutritional Imbalances

![Apop vs Necro](/img/apop_necro.png)

In apoptosis, scavenger cells (phagocytes) digest apoptotic cell fragments (still membrane contained)

In autophagy, autophagosomes within the cell digest the cell contents. Associated with aging, exercise, and some pathologic processes


![Nectrotic Morphologies](/img/necro_morphs.png)

### Inflammation
1. Recognize injurous stimulus
2. Recruit inflammatory cells
3. Remove stimulus (i.e. neutrophil, macrophage)
4. Regulate the response (e.g. avoid septicemia)
5. Repair damaged tissue

Process is interplay of cells and chemical mediators.

![Chemical Mediatiors](/img/inflammation_mediator.png)

Limited acute inflammation: no loss of function
Chronic inflammation: loss of funciton and fibrosis (scar formation)

#### Wound Repair

1st intention: neutrophil inflitration and clot formation, macrophage replacement, total repair within weeks.

2nd intention: Formation of granulation tissue with macrophage, plasma cells, etc. along with fibroblasts. Scar forms and contracts. Loss of function and loss of nerves (sensation loss)

Ex. MI case. Clot blocks blood leading to hypoxia --> less ATP and thus block pumps alongside inflammation --> cell membrane damage allows release of cardiac enzymes (troponin) into bloodstream. This is followed by scar tissue formation.

### Tissue Development

#### Conducting airway

Epithelium
 - Pseudostratified columnar epithelium
 - Polarized

5 different cell types
* Ciliated columnar cells - line apical surface, move via cilliary elevator

    * Thin
    * Optimized for gas exchange
    * Tight junctions
  * Type II pneumocyte
    * Cuboidal
    * Clustered together where two alveoli unite
    * Tight junctions
    * Stem cell properties-make more of both Type I and II cells
    * Secrete surfactant
      * Lipids, phospholipids, proteins
      * Important for lowering surface tension at air-epithelium interface
      * Prevents collapse of alveoli during exhalation
      * Antimicrobial
  * Alveolar Macrophage (Dust Cell)
    * Found in the alveoli airspace and in interalveolar septum
      * Use Pore of Kohn to get around
    * Migrate into the region from the capillary
    * Either stay or leave via sputum or lymphatics
    * Scavenge microbes and inhaled environmental particles
      * Iron and carbon can make them look dark in color

Immune components in the lungs include cilia, mucous (goblet, serous mucous), aveolar macrophages, BALT, lymphocytes and dendritic in lamina propia, respiratory microbiome, tight junctions b/t cells, and surfactants/antimicrobial peptides

## Hematopoiesis

All starts in the bone marrow.
 - G-CSF: granulocye/neutrophil and stem cell mobilization
 - GM-CSF: granulocytes and monocytes
 - M-CSF: monocytes
 - IL-5: Eiosinophils
 - EPO: RBC, produced by kidneys
 - Thrombopoietin (TPO): platelets (made by liver)

Measuring blood:
 - Plasma
 - Buffy Coat
 - Red Cells

OR cell counter which measures change in resistance to count cells automatically

![Blood cell quantification and description](/img/hemocount.png)

Blood cells are visualized using **Wright Giemsa Staining**. Important components of RBC include membrane, hemoglobin, enzymes, 2,3-BPG (DPG). Hemoglobin is composed of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains which bind iron (Fe2+) via prophyrin rings. BPG favors taut (T) form --> O2 offloading.
 - Biconcave shape is due to cytoskeleton. It can deform to fit into small capillary spaces. Most important elements include Band3, Ankryn, spectrin, and ___4.1
 - Enzyme pathways allow RBC to generate energy via Embden Meyerhof pathway (type of glycolysis)

![Heme Binding](/img/O2_dissociation.png)

### Granulocytes
 - Neutrophils: chemotaxis, phagocytosis, killing microorganisms, and respond to infection/inflammation
  - Primary Granules: myeloperoxidase, lysoztme, elastase
  - Secondary Granules: lactoferrin, lysozyme, collagenase
- Eosinophils: electron dense and crystalloid gransules including peroxidase, major basic protein, histaminase, collagenase and acid phosphatase. Allergic and parasitic response. Phagocytotic and killer
- Basophils: histamin and heparin granules, immediate hypersensitivity reactions

### Monocytes
 - Bone marrow --> Blood --> mature to macrophage in tissue
  - Contain many enzymes
  - Phagocytose particular debris and kill macrophage
  - Present to T-cells
  - Destroy RBCs and produce hematopoietic cytokienes (G-CSF, M-CSF)

### Lymphocytes
 - B, T, NK cells: chronic inflammatory response
  - B in bone marrow: humoral immunity
  - T in thymus: cytotoxicity and regulation of autoreactivity
  - Mature reside in lymph tissues
  - More reactive lymphocytes have more cytoplasm (and look a bit more irregular)

### Platelets
 - HSC --> Myeloid stem cell --> commited progenitor --> Megakaryoblast -_endomitosis_-> Megakaryocyte
 - Small anucleate discoid. MPV 7-11fL
 - Membrane glycoproteins
  - GP1b-IX-V: VWF receptor
  - GP1a-IIa, GPVI: collagen receptor 
  - GPIIb-IIIa: fibrinogen receptor (very immunogenic)
 - Granules include alpha (larger more abundant, have VEF, platelet factor 4, fibrinogen, factor V) and delta (ATP, ADP, serotonin, Ca, Mg)

Hemostasis: 
1. injury --> collagen exposure --> VEF binding to GP1b-IX-V --> platelet activation --> fibrinogen receptor exposure --> platelet crosslinking --> aggregation and plug formation
2. Activated factors on platelet surface (X, IXa, VIIIa) join with VWF for prothrombin --> thrombin --> fibrinogen to fibrin clot

# Reading Notes

## Culture-Based Bacterial Testing
### Bloodstream infection (sepsis)
 - blood volume increases sensitivity, esp important in low-level bacteremia in pediatric pt.
 - delays in processing increase FN (ideal is < 4hr) at room temp. Do not pre-incubate
- Pathogens usually detected within 5 days with some exceptions such as filamentous fungi, Nocardia spp. and slow-growing mycobacteria.

### Respiratory Tract
 - URT: anterior nasal to larynx
 	- Include pharyngitis, otitis media, and otitis externa
 - LRT: all structures below larynx


**Paryngitis**
 - culture and nucleic acid or antigen-based methods
** Otitis externa/media**
 - typically a clinical diagnosis
 - Fluid culture is optimal if culture needed, nasopharyngeal not representative

**Pneumonia**
 - commonly culture using sputum or tracheal washes (also include URT). Large number of squamous epithelial --> oropharyngeal contamination. Many polymorphonuclear neukocytes = good specimine (usually)
 - second and later bronchoaveolar lavage aquilots good specimes for LRT


### CNS
 - Immediate processing of CSF when bacterial meningitis suspected. Use second tube when possible (min 5mL) Not super sensitive with previous antibiotics

### UTI
 - Pediatric usually G- enteric (Esp. E. Coli). Innoculate 0.001 mL  - 50k CFU/mL of single organism indicates infection

### GI
 - Usually Selective to Salmonella and Shigella.
 - Routine screening varies between institutions
 - PCR-based multiplex GI panels offer broad range (bacterial, viral, protozoal) detection

## Microscopy and other methods
Can give info on Gram phenotype, morphology, and spatial arrangement
 - Differential stains: Gram, Kinyoun (mycobacterium), Giemsa (bacterial inclusions)
 - Fluorescent stains: acridine, orange, auramine-rhodamine

### Mass Spec
 - Protein spectral profiles compared to known databases for rapid identification with minimal culture

### Molecular Diagnostics
 - Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) detect bacterial NA.
 - Good for fastidious organisms i.e. Chlamydia, Gonorrhoeae, TB, pertussius...
 - Standard of detection in B. pertussis is PCR
 - Esp. useful in pediatric TB detection
 - Used for screening for sexually transmitted bacteria
 - Sequence based technologies check for 16S ribosomal genes and align with those in sequence database for strain ID

## COVID Testing
RNA detection, viral antigen detection, and antibody detection are current test options. It's especially important to consider test characteristics and pretest probability to interpret results.


Typically, URT specimens taken via oropharyngeal, mid-turbinate, or anterior nares swabs then placed in viral transport media. LRT may be indicated with strong suspicion and negative URT. Acute infection is best diagnosed with RNA or viral antigen testing due to time needed for Ab buildup


### Nucleic Acid Detection
 - NAAT is reccomended for acute/current diagnosis. The test targets E, S, and N genes in ORFa/1b and can detect as few as _10 copies_ of RNA per reaction. Multiplex assays can detect covid as well as influenza and bacterial pneumonia.
 - Viral loads appear to be similar in pre or asymptomatic patients and subclinical or symptomatic infections. Should be detectable for at least 1 and up to 6 weeks after symptom onset.


### Viral Antigen Detection
 - Generally LFA detecting nucleocapsid protein antigen from NP and/or nasal swab.
 - Specific antibodies in test strip bind and produce colorimetric/fluorescent signal in 10-15 min.
 - Best for early stage infection with high viral load. May drop below detection 5-7 days post symptom onset.
 - Can have good sensetivity and specificity, esp. in symptomatic pts. However sensitivity varies greatly
 - NAAT confirmation indicated with high pretest probability.

### Ab Detection
Blood or saliva based test detect days or weeks post infection. Typically show IgM/IgA 7-14 and IgG 15-21 days post infection.
 - Tests detect spike or nucleocapsid protein antibodies.
	- S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
	- N protein involved in replication and assembly. Highly conserved

FDA advises against Ab test for immunity or protection esp. in vaccinated pts.

### Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
Complication leading to Kawasaki-like disease in children and adolescents following COVID infection. Rare but serious - requires Ab testing due to presentation from past rather than acute COVID infection.


# Osmosis Notes

## Immune Overview

### Immune System Function:
- The immune system safeguards against harmful microorganisms, toxins, and tumor cells.
- It identifies threats, eliminates pathogens, and develops mechanisms to remember them, typically within 10 days. Prolonged responses lead to chronic inflammation.

### Immune System Branches:

1. **Innate Immune Response**:
    - **Features**: Non-specific, rapid (minutes to hours), no memory.
    - **Components**:
        - **Chemical barriers**: e.g., lysozymes in tears, low pH in the stomach.
        - **Physical barriers**: e.g., skin and gut epithelium, cilia in airways.
    - **Cells**: Macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells.

2. **Adaptive Immune Response**:
    - **Features**: Highly specific, recognizes unique pathogen antigens, slower (takes weeks), has immunologic memory.
    - **Cells**: B cells (produce antibodies), T cells (mediate cell immunity).

### White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):
- Formed via **hematopoiesis** in bone marrow.
- Categories:
    1. **Myeloid cells**: Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes.
        - Neutrophils: Destroy pathogens via phagocytosis, cytoplasmic granules, and oxidative burst.
        - Eosinophils: Fight parasites, involved in allergic reactions.
        - Basophils & Mast Cells: Involved in allergic responses.
        - Monocytes, Macrophages, Dendritic Cells: Phagocytic, present antigens, release cytokines.

    2. **Lymphoid cells**: B cells, T cells, natural killer cells.
        - **Natural Killer Cells**: Destroy virus-infected/cancerous cells.
        - **B Cells**: Recognize antigens directly, produce antibodies.
        - **T Cells**: CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic), recognize antigens presented on MHC.

### Immune Response Progression:
1. Initial barrier breach (e.g., lungs).
2. Innate immune response activated (macrophages, cytokines, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, neutrophils).
3. Dendritic cells bridge innate and adaptive responses, presenting antigens to naive T cells in lymph nodes.
4. B cells might directly present bacteria to CD4+ T cells.
5. T cell differentiation and clonal expansion.
6. CD4+ T cells release cytokines, assisting B cells and macrophages.
7. Plasma cells secrete antibodies.
8. CD8+ T cells target virus-infected cells.
9. Memory B and T cells persist for future threats.

## Innate Immune Response:
- Features:
  - **Non-specific cells**: They don't differentiate between various invaders.
  - **Fast response**: Acts within minutes to hours.
  - **No memory**: Reacts the same way to a pathogen irrespective of past encounters.
- Components:
  - **Chemical barriers**: Examples are lysozymes in tears and low pH in the stomach.
  - **Physical barriers**: Such as skin epithelium, gut epithelium, and cilia in airways.
- **Macrophages**:
  - Act as the body's "garbage trucks," consuming dead cells and pathogens.
  - Reside in tissues and recognize pathogens minutes after an infection.
  - Distinguish between host cells and pathogens using molecules on the surface.
- **Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)**:
  - Unique molecules found on pathogens but not on human cells.
  - Examples include bacterial components (peptidoglycan, LPS, lipoteichoic acid), fungal components (mannan), and flagella proteins. For viruses, PAMPs could be their RNA or DNA.
- **Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)**:
  - Found on immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils).
  - Two main types:
    1. **Phagocytic PRRs**: Bind to PAMPs for ingestion but don't signal other cells.
    2. **Signaling PRRs**: Do not phagocytize pathogens but trigger cytokine release.
- **Phagocytosis**:
  - A macrophage's PRR identifies a PAMP on a pathogen and engulfs it into a vesicle called **phagosome**.
  - The phagosome fuses with a **lysosome** to form a **phagolysosome**.
  - Pathogens are destroyed using granules:
    - **Specific granules**: Contain proteases and hydrolases, work at neutral pH.
    - **Azurophilic granules**: Contain enzymes like Cathepsin G and work best at acidic pH.
  - **Oxidative or Respiratory Burst**:
    - Powerful process destroying 98% of ingested pathogens.
    - Involves production of **nitric oxide (NO)** and **reactive oxygen species**.
    - Initiated by enzyme **NADPH oxidase** which produces toxic substances like hydrogen peroxide.
    - Deficiency in NADPH oxidase can cause **chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)**.
- **Cytokines**:
  - Proteins that cells use to communicate.
  - Triggered by **Signaling PRRs** when there are many pathogens.
- **Toll-like Receptors (TLRs)**:
  - Most crucial group of signaling PRRs.
  - Found on leukocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells.
  - TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are on the cell surface and bind to specific PAMPs.
  - TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are intracellular and bind to viral RNA.
  - Activation leads to the release of **proinflammatory cytokines** (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) causing vasodilation, leukocyte attraction, and fever.
  - Intracellular pathogens trigger the release of **interferon alpha and beta** to inhibit viral replication in nearby cells

## Blood Components

Total blood volume approx 6L. Analysed via blood smear stained with Wright's stain (Eosin, Methylene Blue, and Azures). We look at middle-right of smear. 


### Erythrocytes (45%)
 - % is called hematocrit
	- Low = not being made/destroyed
	- High = dehydration or disease increasing production
 - Carry O2 and CO2, lack organelles and nucleus (more room for hemoglobin)
 - Live about 120 days, regenerated in bone marrow
 - Biconcave shape for increased SA and fit through vessels
 - Stain bright pink/red. Pale center when parallel to slide. 7-8um in diameter

### Buffy Coat
 - Platelets and leukocytes (<1%)
 - Platelets come from megakaryocyte
	- Platlets are small, non-nucleated, basophilic dots 
 - Leukocyte only complete cells and ward off pathogens, destroy cancer cells, and neutralize toxins. Can leave vessels
	- Granulocytes most common (neutrophils mostly, about 60%). Prominent gains in cytoplasm. Neutrophils have 2-5 lobes (Polymorphonuclear leukocytes) with many lysosome and specific granules. Basophils have S-shaped or 2-lobed nucleus with large basophilic/purple granules. Eosinophils have larage eosinophilic pink granules and 2-lobed nuclei.
	- Lymphocytes and monocytes make up about 35%. Large round nuclei with dense staining. Small lymphocytes have low cytoplasm.
	- Monocytes make remaining 5% and are primarily phagocytotic. Largest WBC with large nucleus along edge with horseshoe/indented shape.

### Plasma (55%)
 - 90% water, 10% proteins, ions, and gasses
 	- Albumin maintains oncotic pressure
	- Transport proteins shuttle FA, Ca, Hormones, Meds
	- Globulins include Ab and fat/metal transporters
	- Fibrinogen and other clotting factors assist platlet plug formation. Removing them from plasma leaves you with serum.
 - Electrolytes include Na, Ca, Cl, K, HCO3 and maintain acid base balance and osmolarity.

### Erythropoietin (EPO)

Kidney (and liver) production which stimulates RBC production in the bone marrow. It does so by preventing proerthyroblast apoptosis.
 - Proerythroblasts are immature RBC which mature due to EPO. 
 - Low O2 increases EPO production
	- Decreased bloodflow is not helped by increased erythrocytes. Detected by kidney as lower fluid filtering by glomerulus hence less O2 demand by tubular cells which do not make erythropoietin in response.
	- Decreased O2 content is helped by increased erythrocytes. Tubular cells now have O2 deficit and **do** produce EPO.

All kidney cells can produce EPO. Thus, kidney disease can result in anemia.

![HIF1 pathway](/img/hif1.png)

### Platelet Plug Formation
First step in primary hemostasis.
1. Endothelial Injury - injury to innermost layer of artery (along with SM, protein, and fibrous layer). Nerves trigger reflexive contraction (vascular spasm) to reduce blood flow. Endothelial cells stop producing NO and prostaglandins, instead secreting endothelin (up contraction)
2. Exposure: VWF realeased by damaged endothelial cells binds to exposed collagen
3. Adhesion: platlets contact bound VWF and bind via GP1B surface protein.
4. Activation: Platlet binding via GP1B causes shape change (arms), release of more VWF, Seratonin (platlet attractor) and Ca (secondary homeostasis). They also release ADP and Thromboxane A2 into blood to activate platelets not yet bound to VWF (**Positive Feedback** via platelet activators) limited to injury site due to prostaglandins and NO in undamaged areas inhibiting platelet (platelet inhibitors). Once ADP and Thromboxane A2 bind, platelets express GPIIB/IIIA (fully activated)
5. Aggregation: GPIIB/IIIA receptors bind to fibrinogen and from cross links between other platelets allowing plug formation.
