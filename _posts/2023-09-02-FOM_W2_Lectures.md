## Culture-Based Bacterial Testing
### Bloodstream infection (sepsis)
 - blood volume increases sensitivity, esp important in low-level bacteremia in pediatric pt.
 - delays in processing increase FN (ideal is < 4hr) at room temp. Do not pre-incubate
- Pathogens usually detected within 5 days with some exceptions such as filamentous fungi, Nocardia spp. and slow-growing mycobacteria.

### Respiratory Tract
 - URT: anterior nasal to larynx
 	- Include pharyngitis, otitis media, and otitis externa
 - LRT: all structures below larynx


**Paryngitis**
 - culture and nucleic acid or antigen-based methods
** Otitis externa/media**
 - typically a clinical diagnosis
 - Fluid culture is optimal if culture needed, nasopharyngeal not representative

**Pneumonia**
 - commonly culture using sputum or tracheal washes (also include URT). Large number of squamous epithelial --> oropharyngeal contamination. Many polymorphonuclear neukocytes = good specimine (usually)
 - second and later bronchoaveolar lavage aquilots good specimes for LRT


### CNS
 - Immediate processing of CSF when bacterial meningitis suspected. Use second tube when possible (min 5mL) Not super sensitive with previous antibiotics

### UTI
 - Pediatric usually G- enteric (Esp. E. Coli). Innoculate 0.001 mL  - 50k CFU/mL of single organism indicates infection

### GI
 - Usually Selective to Salmonella and Shigella.
 - Routine screening varies between institutions
 - PCR-based multiplex GI panels offer broad range (bacterial, viral, protozoal) detection

## Microscopy and other methods
Can give info on Gram phenotype, morphology, and spatial arrangement
 - Differential stains: Gram, Kinyoun (mycobacterium), Giemsa (bacterial inclusions)
 - Fluorescent stains: acridine, orange, auramine-rhodamine

### Mass Spec
 - Protein spectral profiles compared to known databases for rapid identification with minimal culture

### Molecular Diagnostics
 - Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) detect bacterial NA.
 - Good for fastidious organisms i.e. Chlamydia, Gonorrhoeae, TB, pertussius...
 - Standard of detection in B. pertussis is PCR
 - Esp. useful in pediatric TB detection
 - Used for screening for sexually transmitted bacteria
 - Sequence based technologies check for 16S ribosomal genes and align with those in sequence database for strain ID

## COVID Testing
RNA detection, viral antigen detection, and antibody detection are current test options. It's especially important to consider test characteristics and pretest probability to interpret results.


Typically, URT specimens taken via oropharyngeal, mid-turbinate, or anterior nares swabs then placed in viral transport media. LRT may be indicated with strong suspicion and negative URT. Acute infection is best diagnosed with RNA or viral antigen testing due to time needed for Ab buildup


### Nucleic Acid Detection
 - NAAT is reccomended for acute/current diagnosis. The test targets E, S, and N genes in ORFa/1b and can detect as few as _10 copies_ of RNA per reaction. Multiplex assays can detect covid as well as influenza and bacterial pneumonia.
 - Viral loads appear to be similar in pre or asymptomatic patients and subclinical or symptomatic infections. Should be detectable for at least 1 and up to 6 weeks after symptom onset.


### Viral Antigen Detection
 - Generally LFA detecting nucleocapsid protein antigen from NP and/or nasal swab.
 - Specific antibodies in test strip bind and produce colorimetric/fluorescent signal in 10-15 min.
 - Best for early stage infection with high viral load. May drop below detection 5-7 days post symptom onset.
 - Can have good sensetivity and specificity, esp. in symptomatic pts. However sensitivity varies greatly
 - NAAT confirmation indicated with high pretest probability.

### Ab Detection
Blood or saliva based test detect days or weeks post infection. Typically show IgM/IgA 7-14 and IgG 15-21 days post infection.
 - Tests detect spike or nucleocapsid protein antibodies.
	- S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
	- N protein involved in replication and assembly. Highly conserved

FDA advises against Ab test for immunity or protection esp. in vaccinated pts.

### Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
Complication leading to Kawasaki-like disease in children and adolescents following COVID infection. Rare but serious - requires Ab testing due to presentation from past rather than acute COVID infection.


# Osmosis Notes

## Immune Overview

### Immune System Function:
- The immune system safeguards against harmful microorganisms, toxins, and tumor cells.
- It identifies threats, eliminates pathogens, and develops mechanisms to remember them, typically within 10 days. Prolonged responses lead to chronic inflammation.

### Immune System Branches:

1. **Innate Immune Response**:
    - **Features**: Non-specific, rapid (minutes to hours), no memory.
    - **Components**:
        - **Chemical barriers**: e.g., lysozymes in tears, low pH in the stomach.
        - **Physical barriers**: e.g., skin and gut epithelium, cilia in airways.
    - **Cells**: Macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells.

2. **Adaptive Immune Response**:
    - **Features**: Highly specific, recognizes unique pathogen antigens, slower (takes weeks), has immunologic memory.
    - **Cells**: B cells (produce antibodies), T cells (mediate cell immunity).

### White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):
- Formed via **hematopoiesis** in bone marrow.
- Categories:
    1. **Myeloid cells**: Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes.
        - Neutrophils: Destroy pathogens via phagocytosis, cytoplasmic granules, and oxidative burst.
        - Eosinophils: Fight parasites, involved in allergic reactions.
        - Basophils & Mast Cells: Involved in allergic responses.
        - Monocytes, Macrophages, Dendritic Cells: Phagocytic, present antigens, release cytokines.

    2. **Lymphoid cells**: B cells, T cells, natural killer cells.
        - **Natural Killer Cells**: Destroy virus-infected/cancerous cells.
        - **B Cells**: Recognize antigens directly, produce antibodies.
        - **T Cells**: CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic), recognize antigens presented on MHC.

### Immune Response Progression:
1. Initial barrier breach (e.g., lungs).
2. Innate immune response activated (macrophages, cytokines, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, neutrophils).
3. Dendritic cells bridge innate and adaptive responses, presenting antigens to naive T cells in lymph nodes.
4. B cells might directly present bacteria to CD4+ T cells.
5. T cell differentiation and clonal expansion.
6. CD4+ T cells release cytokines, assisting B cells and macrophages.
7. Plasma cells secrete antibodies.
8. CD8+ T cells target virus-infected cells.
9. Memory B and T cells persist for future threats.

## Innate Immune Response:
- Features:
  - **Non-specific cells**: They don't differentiate between various invaders.
  - **Fast response**: Acts within minutes to hours.
  - **No memory**: Reacts the same way to a pathogen irrespective of past encounters.
- Components:
  - **Chemical barriers**: Examples are lysozymes in tears and low pH in the stomach.
  - **Physical barriers**: Such as skin epithelium, gut epithelium, and cilia in airways.
- **Macrophages**:
  - Act as the body's "garbage trucks," consuming dead cells and pathogens.
  - Reside in tissues and recognize pathogens minutes after an infection.
  - Distinguish between host cells and pathogens using molecules on the surface.
- **Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)**:
  - Unique molecules found on pathogens but not on human cells.
  - Examples include bacterial components (peptidoglycan, LPS, lipoteichoic acid), fungal components (mannan), and flagella proteins. For viruses, PAMPs could be their RNA or DNA.
- **Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)**:
  - Found on immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils).
  - Two main types:
    1. **Phagocytic PRRs**: Bind to PAMPs for ingestion but don't signal other cells.
    2. **Signaling PRRs**: Do not phagocytize pathogens but trigger cytokine release.
- **Phagocytosis**:
  - A macrophage's PRR identifies a PAMP on a pathogen and engulfs it into a vesicle called **phagosome**.
  - The phagosome fuses with a **lysosome** to form a **phagolysosome**.
  - Pathogens are destroyed using granules:
    - **Specific granules**: Contain proteases and hydrolases, work at neutral pH.
    - **Azurophilic granules**: Contain enzymes like Cathepsin G and work best at acidic pH.
  - **Oxidative or Respiratory Burst**:
    - Powerful process destroying 98% of ingested pathogens.
    - Involves production of **nitric oxide (NO)** and **reactive oxygen species**.
    - Initiated by enzyme **NADPH oxidase** which produces toxic substances like hydrogen peroxide.
    - Deficiency in NADPH oxidase can cause **chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)**.
- **Cytokines**:
  - Proteins that cells use to communicate.
  - Triggered by **Signaling PRRs** when there are many pathogens.
- **Toll-like Receptors (TLRs)**:
  - Most crucial group of signaling PRRs.
  - Found on leukocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells.
  - TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are on the cell surface and bind to specific PAMPs.
  - TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are intracellular and bind to viral RNA.
  - Activation leads to the release of **proinflammatory cytokines** (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) causing vasodilation, leukocyte attraction, and fever.
  - Intracellular pathogens trigger the release of **interferon alpha and beta** to inhibit viral replication in nearby cells
