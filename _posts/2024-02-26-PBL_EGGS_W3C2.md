# Bilirubin metabolism

Bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It is screted into the duodenum after meals and contains phospholipids, electrolytes, bile salts, and bilirubin.

Bilirubin is produced via breakdown of heme released from old RBCs, myoglobin, and cytochromes. Macrophages metabolize heme into biliverdin via heme oxygenase. This is then converted to bilirubin via biliverdin reductase. Unconjugated bilirubin is very insoluble. It is conjugated to glucuronic acid via UDP glucuronyltransferase in the liver creating water soluble conjugated bilirubin.

In the intestines, bacteria convert it back to unconjugated bilirubin via beta-glucuronidase and then convert this to urobilinogen. Urobilinogen is excreted in the feces as stercobilin and reabsorbed by the intestines to the liver and to the urine (as urobilin).

Serum levels are measured via Van den Bergh reaction (for conjugated bilirubin). Indirect reaction via mixing with alcohol first will measure unconjugated bilirubin.Normally, there is no conjugated bilirubin in urine (high levels will lead to dark urine similar to rhabdo, hematuria, or dehydration). Only small amounts of urobilinogen in urine. Jaundice develops early in the sclera and under the tounge at around 3.0mg/dL (normal is <1m.0mg/dL).

# Hyperbilirubinemia

Most cases (55%) of acute jaundice in adults are caused by intrahepatic disorders, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury. The remaining 45% of acute jaundice cases are extrahepatic and include gallstone disease, hemolysis, and malignancy.

A detailed alcohol and drug use history can help identify intrahepatic disorders such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, chronic liver disease, or drug-induced liver injury. A focused review of systems is important. For example, fever and prodromal viral symptoms can precede acute viral hepatitis, fever can be associated with underlying sepsis, and weight loss can be associated with underlying malignancy.

## Conjugated

- **Cholestasis**: lack of bile flow causes impaired bilirubin excretion (will present with cholestatic LFTs: high AlkP >> high ALT/AST). Urine bilirubin will be detected, but urobilinogen will be absent.
    - Extrahepatic: gallstones, pancreatic masses
    - Intrahepatic: alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis
    - Acute cholangitis classically presents with Charcot's triad of jaundice, abdominal pain, rigors, and pyrexia.
- Dubin-Johnson: defective liver excretion of conjugated bilirubin due to abnormal multidrug resistant proteins. May see bilirubin in urine, no pruritis. Liver turns black.
    - Rotor's is milder version with no black liver

## Unconjugated

- **Hemolysis**: high heme metabolism overwhelms the liver causing unconjugated bilirubinemia. High levels of urobilinogen (but no bilirubin) will be present in the urine.
    - Autoimmune hemolytic anemias
    - Sickle Cell
    - Thalassemias
    - Hereditary disorders 
    - Polycythemia vera
- **Rifampin and Probenecid**: compete with bilirubin uptake in liver. Other LFT normal.
- **Gilbert's Syndrome**: decrease in UDP glucuronyltransferase due to defective UGT gene promotor. Can get jaundiced with fasting, fever, heavy exertion, stress, and menses. No serious complications.
- **Crigler-Najjar**: severely reduced or absent UGT.
    - _Type I_: often >20mg/dL. Can cause kernicterus (unconjugated bilirubin in brain) in infants and often fatal
    - _Type II_: less severe <20mg/dL that is often treated with phenobarbital or clofibrate which induce glucuronidation in the liver.
- Neonatal jaundice: higher bilirubin due to RBC turnover along with low UGT (immature at birth) which can cause kernicterus if severe. More common in preemies. Phototherapy can isomerize bilirubin to lumirubin which is more soluble and allows for excretion without conjugation.

### Primary liver diseases:
- More conjugated: **Viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, NASH**
- More unconjugated: **Chronic hepatitis and advanced cirrhosis**
- Early disease will show increased urobilinogen, late will show low urobilinogen

## Pancreatic cancer

The clinical manifestations of pancreatic cancer are nonspecific and include jaundice, unexplained weight loss, epigastric pain that radiates to the back, nausea, new-onset diabetes mellitus and, rarely, migratory thrombophlebitis. Biliary obstruction causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. A classic finding is courvoisier's sign, where there is an enlarged, nontender gallbladder accompanying the jaundice. When a diagnosis of a pancreatic cancer is suspected, imaging must be conducted. Multidetector CT (MDCT) provides excellent resolution of the pancreas and surrounding vasculature and can be used to evaluate other organs for spread of the disease. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is another excellent tool for identification of cysts. This is usually followed by endoscopic FNA.

Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas; this tumour (commonly and here referred to as pancreatic cancer) presents a substantial health problem, with an estimated 367,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2015 and an associated 359,000 deaths in the same year. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201622). Risk factors such as tobacco smoking, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic pancreatitis account for approximately one-quarter to one-third of cases.

It typically has an extremely poor prognosis due to nonspecific or asymptomatic presentation and lack of reliable tumor markers along with a highly agressive and metastatic course precluding curative resection. Current candidates for markers include CA 19-9 and CEA, though they are not entirely reliable (especially CEA). It is also quite resistant to most chemo, radiation, and targeted therapy. Commonly altered genes in pancreatic cancer include KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4. Activating (KRAS) and inactivating (CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4) mutations as well as homozygous deletions and other mechanisms of gene inactivation, such as promoter hypermethylation, are taken into account.

### Therapies

* **Resectable disease**
    * Upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy (gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil)*
* **Borderline resectable disease**
    * Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel with or without chemoradiation followed by surgery
    * Upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy as above
* **Locally advanced disease**
    * Chemotherapy as for metastatic disease (see below).
    * Chemoradiation is not indicated after gemcitabine monotherapy, but is often used after combination chemotherapy as above (followed by surgery in highly selected cases)
* **Metastatic disease (first line)**
    * FOLFIRINOX (for patients with an ECOG performance status of 0–1)*
    * Gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel (for patients with an ECOG performance status of 0–2)*
    * Gemcitabine monotherapy or best supportive care (for patients with an ECOG performance status of >2)
    * Radiotherapy can be used in selected circumstances for palliation of pain and the prevention of pathological fractures
* **Metastatic disease (second line)**
    * Following gemcitabine-based first-line therapy, 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil and liposomal irinotecan)*
    * Following 5-fluorouracil-based first-line therapy, gemcitabine monotherapy or gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel
    * Radiotherapy can be used in selected circumstances for palliation of pain and the prevention of pathological fractures

Biliary obstruction can be relieved by stenting. Exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies can be treated via emperical enzymes.

For cancers of the pancreatic head, a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy (the so-called Whipple procedure) is usually required with or without partial resection of the distal stomach. For tumours of the pancreatic tail, distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy is carried out. A total pancreatectomy with resulting exocrine and endocrine insufficiency (brittle diabetes mellitus) is rarely required except for tumours involving the entire length of the organ.

## Case Drugs

- **Antacids**: neutralize stomach acid through direct chemical reaction, increasing the pH of the stomach contents. This reduction in acidity can alleviate symptoms of acid reflux, such as heartburn and indigestion.
- **Acetaminophen**: Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it is converted into various metabolites. When taken with alcohol, the metabolism of acetaminophen is shifted towards producing a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), more than usual. Normally, NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione, but excessive amounts can deplete glutathione reserves, leading to liver damage and, in severe cases, liver failure.
- **Enalapril**: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This results in vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, and reduced workload on the heart. Additionally, by reducing angiotensin II levels, enalapril indirectly increases plasma renin activity and reduces aldosterone secretion, which helps in reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.
- **Lactulose**: synthetic disaccharide that acts as an osmotic laxative. It is not absorbed in the intestine and reaches the colon unchanged, where bacteria ferment it into short-chain fatty acids. This acidification of the colon contents increases osmotic pressure and fluid retention, which softens stools and promotes peristalsis. Additionally, the acidification of the colon contents can convert ammonia (NH3) into ammonium (NH4+), which is less easily absorbed, thus reducing blood ammonia levels and helping in the management of hepatic encephalopathy.
