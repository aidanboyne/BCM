#### Glycolysis

**Key Irreversible Steps/Enzymes**
1. Glucose --> Glucose-6-P (Consumes ATP)
     - **Hexokinase**: in most tissues other than pancreatic-beta cells and liver. Quickly reaches v<sub>max</sub> and is _inhibitied_ by glucose-6-P.
     - **Glucokinase**: in liver and pancreatic-beta-cells. Very high saturation point, takes in glucose at rate proportional to blood concentrations. Stimulated insulin
2. Fructose-6-P --> Fructose-1,6-BP (Consumes ATP, committed to glycolysis), **Rate limiting step**
    - Stimulated by AMP, citrate, and insulin via **F26BP** **upregulation** (insulin _dephosphorylates_ PFK2 and F26BPase)
    - Inhibited by ATP and glucagon via **F26BP** **downregulation** (glucagon _phosphorylates_ PFK2 and F26BPase)
3. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) --> Pyruvate (Generates ATP)
    - **Pyruvate kinase** inhibited by ATP and alanine, glucagon/epinepherine (phosphorylate PK), **feedforward activation** by F16BP.
        - Skeletal muscles degrade protein --> produce alanine --> goes to liver --> liver converts alanine to glucose via alanine transaminase (we DON'T want liver glycolysis in this situation).

Pyruvate then converted to Acetyl-CoA for TCA cycle or lactate (via LDH) for NAD+ regeneration. NAD+ needed to continue glycolysis. With O2 it is generated in TCA. However need lactate in O2 poor conditions. Too much --> lactic acidosis.

**Net**: 2ATP and 2NADH. With O2 and mitochondria 30-32 depending on shuttle. No O2 or mitochondria --> 2ATP + 2Lactate + 2H20

#### Gluconeogenesis

Converts pyruvate to glucose. Costs energy. Used by liver to form glucose for body from pyruvate or other sources (lactate, AAs, glycerol, odd chain fats). Pyruvate can be converted in alanine cycle in muscle, to lactate in anerobic metabolism (Cori Cycle), **Acetyl-CoA (TCA)**, or used in **gluconeogenesis**.

ATP inhibits TCA --> higher Acetyl-CoA --> activates pyruvate carboxylase (inactive without Acetyl-CoA).

1. Pyruvate --> PEP
    - Pyruvate Carboxylase with CO2, ATP, Biotin to add carbon in mitochondria 
        - Biotin is cofactor for carboxylation (adds carboxylic acid)
    - Malate shuttle to cytoplasm
    - PEPCK uses GTP to add phosphate
2. Fructose-1,6-BP --> Fructose-6-P via Fructose 1,6 bisphosphotase 1. **Rate limiting step**
    - Activated via ATP
    - Inhibited via AMP and Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
3. Glucose-6-Phosphate --> Glucose via Glucose-6-phosphotase
    - Occurs in liver in kidneys in **ER**, other organs shunt to glycogen


**Fructose 2,6 Bisphosphate**
 - High levels --> Glycolysis
 - Low levels --> Gluconeogenesis
 - Made by PFK2 (up with insulin which dephosphorylates), degraded by Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphotase (up with glucagon which phosphorylates)


Gluconeogenesis occurs when there is glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate components in the mitochondria of liver cells. Notably, decreased insulin sensitivity in the liver in T2DM patients results in **increased** hepatic gluconeogenesis (can cause postprandial hyperglycemia).
