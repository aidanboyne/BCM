# Lecture Notes

## Basic Microbiology 

#### Anti-metabolites
 - Sulfonamides and trimethoprim (i.e. bactrim = sulfamethoxolate & trimethoprim)
 - Inhibit _dihydropteroate synthase_ (sulfonamide) and dihydrofolate reductase (trimethoprim) preventing **folic acid synthesis**
  - Not effective on their own due to resistance
  - Used for middle ear, UTI, URI, intestinal infections, and pneumocystis-type pneumonia
### Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis
50% of all antibiotics
- -cillins: penicillin, nafcillin, amoxicillin. **Beta-lactam ring**
  - Penicillinase inactivates beta-lactam. Need Clavulanic acid to inhibit bacterial penicillase

## Respiratory Structure and Function

The lung bud is separated from foregut via tracheoesophageal septum. Connective, cartilagenous, and muscular respiratory structures are from mesoderm while the epithelium of the internal lining is made from endoderm. The phases of development are
1. W4-7: Embryonic. Lung bud develops main --> tertiary bronchi. Defects cause tracheosophageal fistula
2. W5-17: Pseudoglandular. Terminal bronchiole formation
3. W16-25: Canicular - airways increase in diameter and are surrounded by prominary cpillary network. Pneumocyte start W20 and repiration capable W25
4. W26-birth: Saccular - surfactant is detectable in amnionic fluid. Terminal sacs separated by primary septi
5. W36-8yr: Aveolar - adult aveolar development via secondary septation. Increases from 20-70million --> 300-400 million


Oxygenation: O2 in
Ventilation: CO2 out

Also functions in protection (mucus, cilia, macrophages, filtering clots in circulation...), acid-base balance, phonation, pulmonary metabolism (ACE: angiotensin I --> angiotensin II), IgA production.
 - Lungs increase respiration in ketoacidosis. Hypercapnea = acid = CO2 buildup.
 - Angiotensin II: vasoconstrictor involved in RAS.

Sternum lifts superiorly via water-pump effect to accommodate luns during inspiration. Ribs also lifted like "bucket handle". Diaphragm is most important for inspiration (innervated phrenic C3-5 and contraction causes downward movement increasing thoracic volume and decreasing pressure). External intercostals also involved. Accessory scalene, sternocleidomastoid, and pectoralis can be involved in forced inspiration. Expiration is passive with no primary muscles. Active expiration uses abdominal wall and internal intercostals. 

Primary difference between bronchi and bronchioles is **cartilage**. R/L bronchi bifurcate at tracheal **carina**. Everything except alveoli have smooth muscle. Pulmonary acinus is when respiratory bronchiole branches into three (respiratory bronchioles, alveolar duct, and alveoli)

Conducting airway moves air via bulk flow (convection) and is main site of airway resistance (esp. in _medium sized bronchioles_). Resistance then decreases to minimal resistance by resp. zone. Velocity is highest in conducting airway around 3rd generation number. Cross-sectional area increases with generation number and peaks in alveoli.

COPD causes wheezing lung sounds via narrowed airways. 

Autonomic tone is controlled sympathetically (B2 on SM) to dilate while parasympathetic (muscarinic M3) cause bronchoconstriction. Give anti-muscarinic/cholonergic to prevent constriction and B2 agonists to dilate.

Poiseuille's law: Resistance = 8nl/pir<sup>4</sub>. Half radius = 16x resistance

Vascular supply via pulmonary arteries and veins for gas exchange. Bronchial arteries, bronchial veins which are part of _systemic circulation_ to supply nutrition and O2 to conducting airway. Bronchial arteries can drain into pulmonary veins causing small shunt. Bronchial veins drain into intercostal and azygous veins.

Pulmonary arteries have high-flow, low pressure, highly compliant vascular bed. Recives 100% of CO at mean pressure around 15mmHg. 

2 Lymphatics
 - Superficial: along pleural surface
 - Deep (intrapulmonary): adjacent to bronchovascular bundle and along interlobal septa.

First hit **bronchopulmonary lymph node** then tracheobronchial nodes, broncho-mediastinal trunks, and finally into internal jugular and subclavian vein. Sometimes right duct drains into right lymphatic duct and left into thoracic duct. Thoracic crosses around T5 so look at T5 trauma/lesion if we have right pleural effusion.

### Respiratory Zone
 - Respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveoli. Surface area rapidly increases as we move deeper into branches.
 - 300-400 million alveoli per lung with < 0.5mm diameter.
 - Total surface area of alveoli = 85sq.m.
 - T1 pneumocytes 95% of surface area (squamous thin for gas exchange)
 - T2 pneumocytes are proliferative and **produce surfactant**
 - Macrophages remove dust/debris to bronchioles where mucocilliary escalator removes (aka pac-man, heart failure cells)

Capillary network (about 280 billion) surround alveoli. RBC spend < 1sec in capillary bed. Alveolar-capillary unit is site of gas exchange and as moves via simple diffusion. One layer of squamous epithelium on vessel, interstitial layer, then T1 pneumocyte.

### Pressure
- Lungs always tend to _collapse inward_ due to elastic recoil.
- Chest wall wants to _recoil outward_ due to springlike stress.
- Negative pressure in interpleural space is due to these conflicting pressures (usually about  -5mmH20 at rest).  
  - **P<sub>transmural</sub> = P<sub>alveoli</sub> - P<sub>interpleural</sub>**

 Whatever air remains in your lung after normal expiration is _functional residual capacity_ or **FRC**.

Compliance = change in vol/change in pressure. 1/compliance  = _elastance_.
- Emphysema increases compliance, decreases elastance (steeper slope, up FRC)
- Fibrosis decreases compliance, increases elastance (flatter slope, down FRC)
- Lung compliance determined by elastic recoil and surface tension (surface tension is dominant)
- At FRC there are equal and opposite forces of contraction and expansion
  - Below FRC you have lung collapse and tendency to _inspire_ due to **chest wall expansion** pressure
  - Above FRC you have **very high lung collapsing pressure** that causes _expiration_.

![Compliance Diagram](/img/compliance.jpg)

## Lung Histology
### Pneumonia
- Bacterial
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae: community aquired (or H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis)
  - Staph. Aureus: hospital-aquired (or G- rods i.e. klebsiella spp, E. Coli, pseudomonas)
  - Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: immunosupressed, crowded areas, endemic regions
- Viral: COVID, Influenza (or metapneumovirus, RSV, parainfluenzae)
- Fungal
  - Coccidiomycosis: CA and west US
  - Histoplasmosis: Ohio river valley including houston
  - Blastomycosis: East coast

### Lung Cancer
Highest cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Lung carcinomas (95%) and carcinoid tumors (5%) and mesothelioma.
- Small cell: Many small cell with scant cytoplasm, nuclear molding, often very basophilic. No glandular or squamous differentiation. Very associated with smoking and metastasis.
- Carcinoid: Typically peribronchial composed of uniform cells with organoid appearance. No significant atypia, no glandular or squamous differentiation.
- Squamous Cell: Eosinophilic cytoplasm with intercellular bridges. Keratin pearls with irregular nuclei and mitoses
- Mesothieleoma: Pleural location with no definite gland or squamous differentiation
- Adenocarcinoma: Lots of mucin. Some malignant epithelial cells with irregular nuclei and irregular shapes. No normal arrangement. Well-circumscribed

## Radiological Lung Imaging
Most used is CXR. After trauma you usually go straight to CT.
- Typically do PA (standing with nice position hands behind back to rotate shoulder) but can do AP if needed (i.e. cannot get out of bed). Techs usually flip so right side of patient is on left side of image regardless of PA/AP
  - PA almost always has scapula out side of lung field and more acute ange between clavicle and sternum.
  - Lateral can also be taken.

Opacity
1. Black - air
2. Near black - fat
3. Grey - Soft tissue
4. Off-white - Bone
5. White - metal

The patient should not be rotated (look at clavicular symmetry), you should see the full back and costodiaphragmatic space in field of view. Should be able to see vertebrae (else underexposed) but also see pleural lines (else overexposed)

![Heart CXR](/img/heart_cxr.jpg)

## Genetic Testing

Pretest probability in context of genetic testing includes clinical features, family history, and prior family testing and their result. Test should focus on regions where we expect variant from clinical presentation.

Many types of potential genetic variants (not just point mutations, also large sections)
- Chromosomal Variants - Down Syndrome (translocation or trisomony 21)
- DNA packing - nucleosome packing (open or closed). For example, imprinting syndomes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome cause turn-on of _both_ rather than only one copy of the genomes due to improper methylation. 
- Nucleotide variants - BRCA1/2 (cancer suceptibility), FGFR3 (typically 1 of 2 SNVs of glycine in transmembrane domain causes achondroplasia - short stature, limbs, other variants can cause different disorders), sickle cell.

SNV: single nucleotide variant (change 1 AA)
Indel: insertion or deletion of 1-50 nucleotides
Structural Variation: Deletion, Duplication, Inversion, Insertion, or Translocation

Exome sequencing tests the small portion of the genome coding for proteins (around 20k exons) and more specifically the approx. 6k genes associated with medical conditions. ES can detect SNV, Indel, and copy number variants to some extent (if they fall in coding region). Typical exon tests do not test for methylation. Exon sequencing typically has reads of about 150bp and focus on coding regions without much coverage in promoter region. Gene sequencing, on the other hand, will give all promoter, intron, and exon information. It can get SNP, SV, deletion, and repeat expansions. 

Interpreting results: HNF1A c.1340C>T, p.Pro447Leu = base 1340 in coding region of HNF1A was changed from C>T transition. This resulted in AA 447 changing from proline to leucine.


### Choosing a Test
 - Scale: do we suspect chromosomal anomaly or SNV?
 - Coding region, noncoding, particular gene, particular variant?

### Chromosomal Microarray (CMA)
- Primarily detect copy number variants (CNVs)
- Tiling of probes go into plate
- Hybridizing control and patient in each cell
  - More patient than control hybridization --> duplication at this probe location
  - More control than patient hybridization --> deletion at this probe location
- Can also have **SNP array** to detect **absence of heterozygosity** (AOH). These SNPs are common - most of us have different nucleotides at the majority of SNP locations between alleles.
  - Atypical results (absence of heterozygosity) indicate
  - **Copy neutral**: Consanguinity (parents are related to one another) or uniparental disomy (error in zygote - both copies from one parent)
  - **Copy loss**: deletion of one copy of chromosome

**VERY IMPORTANT** in pretest counseling to let parents know the test can detect parental cosanguinity.

## PFTs

### Spiromitry
- Main PFT done
- Usually look at tidal volume, forced vital capacity
  - FVC - degree of lung and chest expansion. How well pt. can blow out rapidly (volume between RV/TLC)
  - FEV1 - vol. air exhaled in first second of FVC effort. Indicates large and small airway funciton
  - FEV1/FVC - defines obstruciton
  - PEF
- After normal spiromitry, can do again with albuterol (4 puffs) to see if there is improvement after 15 min. Positive response is ≥ 10% change. 
- Asthma can be confirmed by bronchoprovocation test via M3 agonist (methacholine). Positive test is > 20% decline in FEV1.

![FV Loop](/img/FV_loop.jpg)

#### Acceptability Criteria
- Make patient breath out for full 6 seconds so we can see FVC (plateau).
- Full inspiration before max exhalation
- repeatable efforts (FEV1, FVC within 0.15 L)
- Max force on exhalation

##### Race and Ethnicity
- NHANES III gives 2 equations: 1 for caucasians and one for black americans
- Should actually just be based on age, gender, and height

### Reading PFT
- Read history, then hit values (esp. FEV1)
- Obstructive diseases make it more difficult to breath _out_ (top of loop)
- Restrictive diseases make it more difficult to breath _in_ (bottom of loop)
- Disease severity is defined by the z-score (how many SD out from normal)

#### Obstructive pattern
- FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC < LLN
- Scalloped appearance as expiratory portion leads to airway collapse, but air in keeps airway open over. 

#### Restrictive pattern
- Lowered FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC ratio. Whole curve shrinks down

#### Variable intrathoracic obstruction
 - During insp. airway is kept open due to negative intrathoracic force
 - During exp. positive pleural pressure causes narrowing of intrathoracic airway (flattened **expiratory limb**)
- Incldude **tracheomalacia, malignant tumors**

#### Variable extrathoracic obstruction
- Located above thoracic inlet. 
- Bernouli causes negative pressure on inhalation, leading to flattened **inspiratory limb**
- Positive pressure keeps airway open on expiration
- Ex. **Glottic strictures, vocal cord paralysis, tumors**

#### Fixed obstruction
- **Flatten Both**
- Ex. post-intubation tracheal stenosis, goiter


### DLCO

DLCO measures the ease with which gases diffuse across the alveolar-capillary- RBC membrane.

* Normal spirometry but low DLCO
  * Pulmonary vascular disease
  * Anemia
* Abnormal spirometry and low DLCO
  * **Restrictive** pattern – interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis
  * **Obstructive** pattern – emphysema, Cystic Fibrosis, bronchiolitis
* Increased DLCO : Decrease alveolar pAO2 (altitude), Increase blood volume (Polycythemia, Pulmonary Alveolar hemorrhage)


![PFT Interpretation](/img/PFT_algo.png)

_Always be sure to provide clinical correlation at the end_

## Pulmonary Infections

LRT infection includes anything below pharynx (trachea and below). Pneumonia has been defined as an infection of the lung parenchyma.

Categorized by
- Viral v. Bacterial (or parasitic/fungal)
- Route of aquisition: inhalation, aspiration, hematogenous, direct extension
- Clinical syndromes
- Nosocomial or community acquired
  - Nosocomial: HAP (hospital, direct or indirect) or VAP (ventilator)

### Pneumonia

Pneumonia is community aquired or nosocomial (hospital acquired). It is also classified based on radiographic pattern: lobar, bronchiolar, interstitial, and other (miliary, nodular...)

- Infection predominantly affects interstitum --> reticular pattern on CXR (intersitial pneumonia)
  - Typically atypical viral pathogens such as **CMV**
  - CMV has both cytoplasmic and nuclear inflitrates in plasma cells.
- Filling of alveoli with pus, fluid --> fluffy infiltrates (bronchiolar pneumonia)
  - Typically **_Staph. Aureus_** or **_viral_** (influenza/COVID)
- Complete desctruction of lobe --> segmental consolidation (lobular pneumonia)
  - Typically **_Strep. peneumonia_**

#### Special Considerations
- Nodular (usually need CT)
  - Suspect fungus
- Pneumothroax (esp in HIV)
  - Think pneumocystis jiroveci (hit with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
- Miliary appearance
  - Think TB

Defense aginast LRTI:
 - Innate: Mucocilliary escalator, macrophages in alveoli, coughing/sneezing 
 - Adaptive: infiltration of T-cells, presentation in lymphatic system

#### Initial assesment
- Symptoms: weight loss, chronic syndromes, timing
- Epidemiological: where do they live, travel, exposures
- Underlying lung disease
- Immune status
- Physical signs on exam
  - Egophany: say "eee" hear "ahhhy" - indicates consolodation w/ pleural effusion
  - Bronchophony: type of pectoriloquy, which is when voice transmission through lung structures is heard with a higher resonance - atypical increase in the intensity and clarity of voice heard with stethoscope
  - Whispered pectoriloquy: increased clarity of whispered words
  - Coarse Crackles (rales)
- Lab work and imaging
  - CURB 65 (1 = 1.5%, 2 = 9.2%, 3 = 22%). Consider hospitalization for 2+
    - Confusion
    - Urea > 7mmol/L (about 20mg/dL)
    - BP SBP < 90, DBP < 60
    - Age > 65
  - Pneumonia severity index has 20 variables. I is low risk, V is high risk

#### Treatment of CAP
- Outpatient
  - No comorbidities or risk factors for MRSA or Pseudo. Aeruginosa.
    - Amoxycillin or doxycycline or macrolide (if local resistance < 25%)
  - With comorbitidies 
    - Combo with amoxicillin/clavulanate or cephalosporin + macrolide or doxycycline or monotherapy with resp. fluroquinolone
- Inpatient
  - Low-risk: B-lactam + macrolide or fluroquinolone
  - High-risk: B-lactam + macroline or B-lactam + fluroquinolome

If we have risk of MRSA (abx in last 90 days): IV vancomycin or linezolid
If we have risk of Pseudomonas: **piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime**, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, aztreonam

#### Treatment of HAP/VAP
1 antibiotic effective against Pseudomonas and MSSA (something different than what they had previously if applicable)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam
* Cefepime
* Ceftazidime
* Imipenem
* Meropenem
* Aztreonam
MDR risk: Second abx for double pseudomonas 
MRSA risk: IV vancomycin or linezolid

#### Lung tranplant
- Early (< 1mo): Bacteria/aspiration/nosocomial pathogens 
- Middle (1-6mo): CMV, pneumocystic, aspergillus/endemic fungi, nocardia
- Late (> 6mo): Pneumocystis, aspergillus, granulomatous reactivation (nocardia, fungi, mycobacteria)

## Pulmonary Exam

_To do **in addition to** survey physical_

### Cough
1. Timing
Acute: bronchitis, pneumonia, post-viral
subacute:
chronic: UACS, GERD, Asthma, COPD, ILD

2. Dry or productive (bacterial, viral, allergic)
3. Sputum characteristics (thickness, color)
4. Kind of cough (harsh, barking,...)
5. When is it better/worse
6. Precipitating/reliving factors 

ROS
 - SOB?
 - Exertional fatigue or limitations
 - Wheezing?
 - What kind of cough
 - Sputum?
 - Hemoptisis
 - Chest pain (esp while breathing, on inspiration/expiration, location)

Also general: fever, chills, body aches, night sweats, unexplained weight loss


### Pulmonary Exam

1. Wash hands
2. Inspect/observe chest wall and breathing
  - Should be effortless, 12-24/min, not much breath (about 500cc), inhalation (2/3) longer than exhalation (1/3)
  - Check for chest defomaties, muscle involvement 
3. Chest excursion: place hands on back and breath deeply for 3 cycles. Movement of ribs
  - Normal: chest excursion full, symmetric
  - Abnormal: reduction due to pleural effusion, diaphramatic paralysis, rib issues
4. Percussion: place nondominant hand middle finger firmly on posterior back. Do 3x per side of chest.
	- Normal: resonant to percussion bilaterally
	- Abnormal: dull (fluid, pnumonia), or hyperresonant (pnemothorax)
5. Pulmonary ascultation: "take some deep breaths in and out through your mouth"
	- Full breathing cycle at 3 levels posterior, 2 levels anterior
	- Noraml: clear to ausculation b/l _or_ vesicular throughout
	- Note bronchial breathing: loud, harsher --> suggests solid density i.e. pneumonia mass or atelectasis
	- Note extra sounds i.e. crackles (rales), wheezes, rhonchi 
6. Egophony: ask patient to say letter "E" while auscultating
	- Normal: muffled EE sound
	- Abnormal: sounds more like Ayy (consolidation)
7. Tactile fremitus: "karate chop" hands on posterior chest wall at 3 levels b/l. Ask p.t. to recite "ninety-nine" and assess for symmetry
	- Normal: "symmetric tactile fremitus
	- Reuced: pleural effusion, can be increased in consolidation (pneumonia)

When listening, make sure you hit apex of lung (above the clavicle). In practice, physicians just do inspection/observation and auscultation. Only do the rest if something is abnormal.

Abnormal observations:
Chest wall: shingles rash, truamatic bruising, pectus excavatum (congenital), barrell chest (COPD).
Breathing patterns: labored, forced, rapid, or irregular breathing, obstructed exhalation (exhale > inhale, using abs to push air out), intercostal retractions, tachypnea, flail chest
Chest excursion: asymmetrical due to large pleural effusion, pneumothorax, diaphram paralysis

Auscultation: 
	- pleural fluid: quiet, dull to percussion, decreased fremitus
	- consolidation: loud bronchial sounds, dull, increased fremitus, egophany
	- Pneumothroax

Increased "vocal resonance" can be known as whispered pectoriloquy (louder whisper on auscultation) 

Crackles/rales: discontinuous pooping from airway popping open (coarse, fine, or v. fine (fibrosis))
	- Late inspiratory: most common, smaller airway eg. heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis)
	- Early inspiratory: obstructive (COPD, asthma)
	- Mid-inspriatory - bronchiectasis

Wheezing: high pitched and musical
Rhonchi: low pitched (like a snore)

Both caused by turbulence in narrowed airway (asthma, COPD, heart failure)

## Ethics

### Belmont Report
1. Respect for persons: treat those as autonomous and protect those without autonomy
2. Beneficience: efforts to reduce harm and maximize benefit for participants. Kidness is obligatory
3. Justice: Burdens of research should be distributed equally amoung parties

### IRB Review
1. Exempt: very little risk, educational research
2. Expidited: minimal risk and no invasive procedures, little emotional risk
3. Full: high risk, invasive, special pops, may involve deception



# Other Notes

## TB

Caused by aeorbic mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rod-shaped gram (+) bacteria. Cell wall is waxy due to high **mycolic acid** content and will not stain with normal gram. Need _Acid Fast_ Ziehl-Neelsen strain. The wall allows resistance and survival on dry surface for months.

Risk factors
1. Immunosupression
2. Iatrogenic Immunosupression
3. Systemic disease
4. Extremes of age
5. Substance abuse
6. Homeless, prisoners, healthcare workers, and endemic regions

### Primary TB 
 - Sulfatide in TB allows them to survive macrophage lysis and survive in macrophage. Asymptomatic for awhile.
    - Inside the phagosome, mycobacteria form serpentine-like cords using **cord factor**, a hydrophobic surface glycolipid. This response allows the mycobacteria to form cylindrical micelles and prevents the bacteria from being acidified by lysosomal enzymes. Additionally, the presence of **sulfatides**, another glycolipid, prevents fusion between phagosomes with lysosomes
 - TB cord factor released around 3 weeks and provoke macrophages Th<sub>1</sub> cells that form granulomas (type IV hypersensitivity).
 - **Langhans giant cells** with multiple nuceli in shape of horseshoe line outer edge of granulomas (formed from macrophages) and contain schauman bodies and astroid bodies
 - Granulomas are caseating due to caseous necrosis in center of mass (Ghon Focus)
 - Spread to hilar lymph node  causes _Gohn complex_. Typically subpleural and are characteristic of primary TB. In children and immunocompromised pateitns, TB continues to spread. Most cases result in containment with fibrosis and calcification forming a **Ranke Complex**.
  - Sometimes it heals
  - Sometimes it becomes secondary TB if immune system is compromised.
- Ghon reactivation causes infection of upper lobes, more caseous necrosis and causing fibrocaseous cavities that can allow dissemination
  - Bronchopneumonia
  - Bacteremia
- Military TB (systemic) commonly causes sterile pyuria, meningitis, pott disease in lumbar vertebrae, addison's dissease, hepatitis, lymphadentis in neck, mycobacterial arthritis, and osteomyelitis.


Primary TB
 - Asymptomatic or classic findings of fever, night sweats, weight loss, non-productive/productive cough, and hemoptsis.
 - Screen with purified protein derivative intradermal skin test. Tuberculin injected and produces small local reaction in 48-72hr. Large area of induration = positive test (has been exposed, does not differentiate between types). False positives with vaccination and false negative in sarcoidosis or immunocompromised
 - Interferon Gamma release assay (IGRA) also used and are more specific. 
 - Either test positive warrants chest X-ray. Look for Ghon complexes (primary), cavitation and scarring (secondary), small distributed, uniform nodules (miliary).
 - Get 3 samples of sputum for staining, culture on lowenstein jensen agar, NAAT, and potential nodule biopsy.

Treatment:
 - Prophylaxis: **Isoniazid**
 - Latent: **Rifamycin** 4mo. (preferred) or **isoniazid** 9mo. monotherapy
 - Active: **RIPE**: rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol.
    - Second line solo agent **streptomycin** can be added to RIPE if needed
    - **Rifampin** is a transcription blocker (no mRNA) and is good for large range of bacteria. Minor hepatotoxicity and orange body fluid.
    - **Isoniazid** inhibits mycolic acid synthesis (specific to TB) and need to be processed by mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase (mutations cause resistance). P450 inhibition and hepatotoxicity. Drug induced lupus, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and _seizures refractory to benzos_ are possible side effects. **Vitamin B6 deficiency** can cause peripheral neuropathy and sideroblastic anemia - administer with pyridoxine.
    - **Pyrazinamide** works in phagolysosome (good against TB in lysosome). Hepatotoxic, hyperurecimia
    - **Ethambutol** prevents cell wall polymerization in mycobacteria via inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Can lead to _reversible optic neuritis_
    - Streptomycin is aminoglycoside that inhibits 30s. Mutations leading to resistance are common.
 - MDR-TB and XDR-TB are very hard to treat. Pretomanid + bedaquiline + linezolid can help most XDR-TB


## Sketchy Antibiotics

### Cell wall and membrane active

#### Beta-lactams

##### Penicillin
- Inhibit transpeptidation reaction in cell-wall synthesis by covalently binding **PVPs**
- Generally good activity against gram+ bacteria
  - Good for strep and staph
- Only work in _activley growing cells_
- Penicillin V is acid stable, but poorly available.
  - Good for streptococcal pharyngitis
- Penicillin G is IV or IM (in salt form).
  - Strep viridans and strep bovis (endocarditis) are treated with penicillin G
  - Also used for intrapartum prophylaxis against group B strep
  - Can penetrate CNS in active inflammation for Neisseria meningitidis treatment (**only Gram negative**)

V and G used in treatment of rheumatic fever, actinomyces israelii, clostridium perfinges (gangrene), pasteurella multicoda (dog bite), secondary syphilis (treponema pallidium).

Most common method of resistance is beta-lactamase expression (often from plasma genes). Adverse reactions include IgE mediated type I hypersensitivity, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and interstitial nephritis. 

##### Nafcillin, Oxacillin, Methicillin, and Dicloxacillin
- Bulky R-groups prevent beta-lactamase binding. Narrow spectrum of activity. Good against MSSA (naf for staph!). 
  - Good for skin and soft tissue infections and good for endocarditis and osteomyelitis when given by IV.
  - Not effective against methicilin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) produce PBP with low affinity for beta-lactam abx. 

##### Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Piperacillin, and Ticarcillin
- Broad spectrum (gram positive and negative action). Beta-lactamases confer resistance
  - Usually administered with clavulanate, a beta-lactamate inhibito
- Amoxicillin has greater oral availability than other aminopenicillin ampicillin and is often used for strep pharyngitis along with:
  - Otitis media and sinusitis
  - Pneumonia
  - H-flu (haemophilis influenzi)
  - Helicobacter Pylori
  - Lyme disease
- Ampicillin is IV administrated good for serious anaerobic infections such as inhalation pneumonia, listeria monocytogenes (very young and old patients), and enterococcus. 
- Associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (bad) or minor skin rash (not bad, usually with Epstein-Barr). Can induce liver injury
- Piperacillin and Ticarcillin are also paired with beta-lactamase inhibitors such as tazo, clavulanate, and are good for anaerobic infections _especially pseudomonas_ in hospital setting.
