## Pathophysiology

Breast cancer is uncontrolled growth of breast epithelial cells (thus an **adenocarcinoma** - epithelial neoplasia) due to DNA damage and genetic mutations which can be confined within the ducts or spread into the surrounding breast tissue. The disease development process can be influenced by estrogen exposure. It is the most common form of cancer in biological females (lifetime prevalence of 12.4% in US) and is second only to lung cancer in terms of cancer deaths in females.

### Risk Factors
* Increased estrogen exposure
    - Early menarche, late menopause, post menopausal obesity, hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, lack of breast feeding.

  _Estrogen and Breast Cancer_

* Age 
* Genetic predisposition
* BRCA1 and 2, PTEN, PalB2 mutations
  * BRCA1 and 2 produce proteins that assist in gene repair
* Family / personal history of breast cancer
* Radiation exposure
* Secondary to radiation therapy – Lymphoma treatment
* Environmental factors

Breast cancer is most common in non-hispanic white and black women, followed by hispanic, native, and finally asian women. 

#### BRCA1 and BRCA2 [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470239/)

Both are autosomal dominant tumor suppressor genes that significantly increase risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Ashkenazi Jewish people are known to have higher rates of BRCA1/2 mutations. However, only 5-8% of breast cancer cases are positive for BRCA when tested.

**BRCA 1 Mutation**
* Responsible for approximately 35% of hereditary breast cancer
* Typically triple negative breast cancer
* Increased risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 to 44% to 78%
* Increased risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 70 to 18% to 54%
* Increased risk of developing male breast cancer by age 70 to 0.22 to 2.8%

**BRCA 2 Mutation**  
* Responsible for approximately 25% of hereditary breast cancer
* Typically ER+ subtype
* Increased risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 to 31% to 56%
* Increased risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 70 to 2.4% to 19%
* Increased risk of developing male breast cancer by age 70 to 3.2% to 12%

Testing is generally not recommended in patients without a personal history of breast cancer unless a first or second-degree relative had breast cancer prior to 45, two or more primary breast cancers in single family member, two or more relatives on same side of family with breast/pancreatic cancer, family history or male breast cancer, known mutation carrier in family, history of ovarian, fallopian, peritoneal cancers, or Ashkenazi Jewish heritage with family history of breast cancer.

Testing is recommended in patients with cancer if they had it before 50, had a ER-PR-HER2 negative tumor, or have extensive family history.

#### Mismatch repair

The goal of DNA replication is to provide an identical replica of cellular genes. However, DNA damage can occur due to both environmental and internal factors and enters the _G0_ phase. 

There is 1/100k chance of incorrect base pairing (mismatch) or about 60k times per replication. DNA polymerase proofreads and acts as an exonuclease during the replication process. If there are still errors (usually 600 total):
1. MSH proteins then come in, acting as endonuclease and severs nucleotide bonds
2. MSH exonuclease then removes damaged segment
3. DNA polymerase repairs the segment
4. DNA ligase re-seals nucleotide bonds

On average, 6 errors are left after each replication cycle. Lynch syndrome and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome are disorders in the mismatch genes that lead to higher cancer relevance.


## Clinical Guidelines

### Classification
Ductal carcinoma progresses from a normal duct to DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ). It can then escape the duct becoming _invasive_ ductal carcinoma. If it travels beyond breast tissue, it is _metastatic_ ductal carcinoma. Lobular carcinoma similarly can progress from in situ to invasive lobular carcinoma. We can also have cancers originating from fat (lymphoma), other organs (metastatic tumors), blood vessels (angiosarcomas), etc.

#### Histology

![Histology Examples](/img/Breast_histology.PNG)

**A**: DCIS, **B**: Invasive ductal carcinoma, **C**: Slide with both LCIS and invasive lobular carcinoma

![Mitotic Figures](/img/Mitoticfigures.png)

**Mitotic Figures**: Normal and abnormal cells at various stages of cell division. Abnormal mitotic figures include those with multipolar chromosomes (9,13), bridging during separation (11, 12), or asymmetrical separation (10).


### Diagnosis
If breast cancer is suspected, biopsy is usually performed. Imaged guided biopsy uses fluoroscope or ultrasound guidance to direct the needle. Core needle biopsies are the gold standard and extract a piece of the suspected tumor for pathology evaluation. Fine needle aspiration can also be used with less risk of complication but is less sensitive.

![Diagnostic Pathway](/img/breast_diagnosis.PNG)

#### Differentials
 - Fibroadenoma: benign breast lesion. Often asymptomatic and found incidentally.
 - Fibrotic Disease of the breast: benign cystic changes in fibrous breast tissue occurring prior to menstruation.
 - Lipoma: Benign tumor of mature fat cells.
 - Mastitis: inflammation of milk duct often caused by infection. More common during lactation

Once diagnosis is confirmed and type is determined:
How well the carcinoma resembles normal breast tissue (Grade of carcinoma)
* Does the cancer form glands
* Are the nuclei uniform or vary in shape and size
* Is it mitotically active

In our case, we are told the mammography reveals a “2.8 cm irregular spiculated mass with an associated architectural distortion and surrounding suspicious calcifications ... in the left upper outer quadrant middle depth." Here, **spiculated** means spiny and is associated with invasive breast cancers, **irregular** boundaries are also indicative of invasive cancer rather than a benign differential. **Architectural Distortion** refers to pulling or twisting of the tissue, or an area where normal tissue pattern is disrupted. The **upper outer quadrant** is the most common site of breast cancer.

This is followed by evaluation of the tumor for expression of Estrogen receptor (ER), Progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2 neu (erbB2) using immunohistochemistry based stains 
 - These markers, thought to be caused by somatic mutation, help guide therapy and predict how well the cancer will respond to therapy.
    - Her2: Human epidermal growth factor 2.  Her2-positive (Her2+) breast cancers have high levels of the Her2 protein or have many copies of the Her2 gene. These cancers tend to grow and spread more aggressively than Her2-negative tumors.
    - ER: Estrogen receptor. These cancers can grow in response to estrogen. 
    - PR: Progesterone receptor. The presence of PR suggests that the cancer cells may be responsive to endocrine treatment.

### Immunohistochemistry 

Sequential steps in IHC:
 - Antigen retrieval (AR): pretreatment of tissue to retrieve antigens masked by fixation and make them more accessible to antibody binding, typically through heating via microwave or autoclave. The sample is then usually blocked with serum or buffer
 - Addition of primary antibody:  titrated to optimize contrast between positively staining tissue and nonspecific background staining, with the highest primary antibody dilution to prevent waste. Typically monoclonal for specificity or polyclonal for sensitivity.
 - Application of a secondary antibody that binds the primary antibody, allowing for enzymatic signal amplification
 - Addition of a detection reagent to localize the primary antibody (HRP, fluorescent probes...)
  


#### TNM Staging

1. **T (Tumor)**
    - **T0**: No evidence of primary tumor.
    - **Tis**: Carcinoma in situ (includes ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ).
    - **T1**: Tumor ≤ 20 mm in greatest dimension.
      * Subcategories include T1a, T1b, and T1c based on specific size ranges.
    - **T2**: Tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 50 mm.
    - **T3**: Tumor > 50 mm.
    - **T4**: Tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin.
      * Subcategories include T4a (chest wall), T4b (edema or ulceration of skin or satellite skin nodules), T4c (both T4a and T4b), and T4d (inflammatory breast cancer).

2. **N (Nodes)**
    - **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
    - **N1**: Metastasis in movable ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s).
      * Subcategories include N1mi (micrometastases) and others based on specific node involvement.
    - **N2**: Metastasis in fixed or matted ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes.
    - **N3**: Metastasis in ipsilateral infraclavicular, supraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes.
      * Further subcategories define specific combinations of lymph node involvement.

3. **M (Metastasis)**
    - **M0**: No distant metastasis.
    - **M1**: Distant metastasis present (e.g., bones, liver, lungs).


**Grading** takes into account **histologic characteristics** (well differentiated (similarity to local tissue), mitotic figures)

After the TNM values have been determined, they are combined to assign an overall stage, from stage 0 (in situ), I (small tumor), to stage IV (metastatic).


### Treatment

![BC Treatment](/img/breast_carcinoma_treatment.png)

The 2 basic principles of treatment are to reduce the chance of local recurrence and the risk of metastatic spread. Surgery with or without radiotherapy achieves local control of cancer. When there is a risk for metastatic relapse, systemic therapy is indicated in the form of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or any combination of these. In locally advanced disease, systemic therapy is used as a palliative therapy with a small or no role for surgery.

#### Surgical
 - Lumpectomy: removal of local tumor only.
 - Breast conserving mastectomy: removal of local tumor and margins. 
 - Full mastectomy: complete removal of breast tissue. Often indicated in semi-advanced invasive cases without metastasis.
 - Full bilateral mastectomy: complete removal of both breasts. Can be indicated in BRCA carriers post-cancer or even prophylactically. 

 Mastectomy is usually accompanied with sentinel lymph node biopsy. If cancer has spread to lymphatic system, total axillary lymph removal is indicated. Mastectomy may be contraindicated in patients with proven distant metastatic disease. Also, frail or elderly patients with significant medical co-morbidities or systemic organ dysfunction may not be candidates for surgery due to the burden of their overall health and poor performance status.

#### Biologics

**HER2 Receptor**: transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains 4. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression


 - Trastuzumab: HER2 targeted monoclonal Ab infusion. Targets subdomain IV of the HER2 extracellular domain, exerting its antitumor effect by blocking HER2 cleavage, downstream proliferation pathways, and promoting apoptosis. Additionally, it stimulates endocytosis and prevents shedding of the extracellular domain of HER2. Lastly, it triggers antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
    - Generally well tolerated
    - Has shown increase in cardiotoxicity when taken with chemotherapy.
 - Pertuzumab: HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody that belongs to the class of HER dimerization inhibitors. It binds to a different domain of HER2 than trastuzumab (subdomain II), preventing the HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and homodimerization. This inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling via the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways. Inhibition of these pathways results in inhibition of cell growth and the initiation of apoptosis, respectively.
    - No indication of increased cardiotoxicity with chemo.
    - Frequent side effects include diarrhea

#### Radiotherapy

The risk of cancer recurrence decreases by about 50% at 10 years, and the risk of breast cancer death reduces by almost 20% at 15 years when radiation therapy follows BCS. However, radiation is not necessary for women 70 years of age and older with small, lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cancers because it has not been shown to improve survival in patients who take hormonal therapy for at least 5 years. Radiation therapy is beneficial in large tumors (greater to 5 cm) or if the tumor invades skin or chest wall and if there are positive lymph nodes. It can also be used as palliative therapy in advanced cases, such as a central nervous system (CNS) or bone metastasis. It can be delivered as external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or a combination of both.

#### Chemotherapy

General guidelines indicate three to 6-month period for adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with first gen drugs or Anthracyclines. Adjuvant treatment of early-stage HR+ breast cancer with tamoxifen (Selective estrogen receptor modulator) for at least 5 years has been shown to reduce the recurrence rate by about half throughout the first 10 years and reduces breast cancer mortality by about 30% throughout the first 15 years. Recent studies support extended adjuvant tamoxifen (10 years versus 5 years) to reduce reoccurrence and mortality so clinical practice guidelines now recommend consideration of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for 10 years. 

### Screening [[ref]](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html)

For patients with average risk (no personal or strong family history of breast cancer, no BRCA mutation, no chest radiation):
* Women between 40 and 44 have the option to start screening with a mammogram every year.
* Women 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year.
* Women 55 and older can switch to a mammogram every other year, or they can choose to continue yearly mammograms. Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live at least 10 more years.

In patients with known BRCA mutation(s), early detection begins with breast awareness and self-breast examination beginning at age 18 and annual or semiannual clinical breast examination at age 25 (though neither of these has shown to benefit survival) [5].

Breast MRI increases sensitivity from approximately 33% to approximately 80% sensitivity in the detection of malignancy in patients with a familial or hereditary predisposition and has proven especially useful in this younger subset of patients. According to the NCCN guidelines, annual screening breast MRI with contrast is recommended annually from age 25 to 29 if available, or mammogram annually, if not. From age 30 to 75, annual mammogram and MRI of the breast with contrast is performed.

#### Mammography

Mammography (also called mastography) is the process of using low-energy X-rays (usually around 30 kVp) to examine the human breast for diagnosis and screening. The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses or microcalcifications. However, there is debate concerning routine mammography in otherwise healthy patients, with many studies and review claiming it does more harm than good [[ref]](https://web.archive.org/web/20120905132426/http://www.cochrane.dk/screening/mammography-leaflet.pdf).

#### Screening Terminology

- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: The probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease.   
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: The probability that a person with a negative test result does not have the 
- **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**: The ability of the test to correctly identify those with the disease. 
- **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**: The ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease.
- **False Positive Rate (Type I error)**: The probability that a person without the disease tests positive.
- **False Negative Rate (Type II error)**: The probability that a person with the disease tests negative.
- **Prevalence**: The proportion of people in the population who have the disease.

## Histology

### Staining
* H&E stain: most frequently used combination for general staining of skin samples and is especially useful in the diagnosis and classification of cancer.
  * Haemotoxylin stains negativley charged parts of the cell – like the nucleus (DNA, RNA, GAGs) – blue/purple
  * Eosin stains positively charged parts of the cell – such as the cytoplasm and matrix proteins – red or pink.
* Mucin stains: best for the detection and dying of mucopolysaccharides. Examples of mucin stains include:
  * Alcian blue
  * Mucicarmine
  * Period acid-Schiff (PAS).
* Melanin stains: used for dyeing melanin and are commonly used in the diagnosis of melanoma. One typical example of a melanin stain is the Fontana-Masson.
* Trichrome stains: use a combination of three different dyes to achieve their effect. These are used explicitly to dye lipids. Common trichrome stains include:
  * Gomori trichrome
  * Mallory trichrome
  * Sudan stains. One particular Sudan stain, known as Red Oil O, is frequently used in the diagnosis of fat emboli in the lungs.

### Paraffin Sections

1. **Fixation**: The tissue sample is placed in a fixative, typically **10% neutral buffered formalin**, to preserve cellular and tissue structures.
2. **Dehydration**: The fixed tissue is passed through a series of increasing concentrations of **alcohol** (usually ethanol) to remove water from the tissue.
3. **Clearing**: The tissue is then treated with a solvent like **xylene** to remove the alcohol and make the tissue transparent.
4. **Infiltration**: The tissue is soaked in melted **paraffin wax**, which replaces the xylene and infiltrates the tissue.
5. **Embedding**: The infiltrated tissue is placed in a mold filled with melted paraffin and allowed to solidify, forming a **paraffin block**.
6. **Sectioning**: Thin sections (typically 4-6 micrometers thick) are cut from the block using a **microtome**.
7. **Staining**: The sections are placed on glass slides and stained with dyes such as **hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)** to highlight different tissue components.

### Frozen Sections

1. **Fixation**: This may or may not be done for frozen sections. If used, the tissue is briefly fixed in **liquid fixative**.
2. **Freezing**: The tissue is rapidly frozen using a substance like **liquid nitrogen** or a freezing agent, such as **OCT compound** (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound).
3. **Sectioning**: Thin sections (typically 10-20 micrometers thick) are cut from the frozen tissue block using a **cryostat**, a special microtome that operates at subzero temperatures.
4. **Staining**: The sections are placed on glass slides and stained using dyes like **hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)**, similar to paraffin sections.

Frozen sections are especially useful for intraoperative consultations because they can be prepared rapidly, allowing pathologists to provide surgeons with immediate feedback during a procedure. However, the quality of the tissue morphology is typically better in paraffin sections.
