## Diabetes Mellitus

### History and Physical

#### History with chronic illness

Goal is to summarize history and current state of chronic conditions with implications for management in mind. Try to assess current control of illness and minimize its impact and potential complications. In addition, include medications, pysiologic parameters measured at home, and recent lab/specialist visits.

OLD CARTSS for chronic illness
 - **Onset**: For how long has the patient had the chronic illness?
 - **Location**: Is the condition being managed by any other clinics or clinicians? This is common, and care coordination is important. 
 - **Diagnosis and details**: There are different subtypes and causes for most conditions. Has appropriate workup been done to determine type or underlying etiology? 
 - **Control**: How well is the disease controlled? Depending on the condition, can be based on symptoms (e.g. arthritis), blood work (diabetes), or other measurements (blood pressure). What are the trends over time? 
 - **Aggravating/Alleviating factors**: Anything currently making symptoms or level of control ; can include medical or psychosocial factors (eg can’t afford meds, special diet, no time for exercise) 
 - **Radiation, relationship**: How condition is or is not impacting patient’s life including other health conditions, functioning, mood, family and work obligations, as applicable
 - **Treatments**: What medications, lifestyle efforts, or other therapies are being used to control the condition? Are there any side effects, concerns, or access issues related to these therapies..
 - **associated Syndromes**: What complications are associated with the chronic condition, and what are we doing / need to do to prevent these. For example, patients with diabetes need eye exams and monitoring of kidney function. Patients with high blood pressure are at risk for cardiac disease. Etc. Data may include relevant symptoms (no shortness of breath), blood work (normal kidney function 2 months ago), or specialist visits (last eye exam 1 year ago, needs another one). 
 - **Severity**: Some overlap with level Control, but how advanced or significant is the condition. 


Indications of DM in undiagnosed patients include:
 - increased thirst and urination
 - low energy, fatigue
 - bacterial and fungal infections with slow wound healing
 - tingling/numbness in extremities (neuropathy should be ruled out by exam/history)
 - blurred vision (retinopathy should be excluded by ophtho)
 - high BMI

## Pathophysiology

#### Types of Diabetes
**Type I**: autoimmune disease. Results in pancreatic beta cell destruction and DKA without insulin therapy due to complete deficiency of insulin. One of the most prevalant chronic pediatric diseases but can onset at any age and accounts for 5-10% of all DM cases.

Patients may present with symptoms of hyperglycemia such as weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, nocturnal enuresis, and blurry vision. T1DM patients may present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a state of severe dehydration and acidemia due to insulin deficiency. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, inattention, confusion, and even DKA coma in the setting of hyperglycemia and elevated anion gap. DKA is often associated with compensatory hyperventilation (Kussmaul respiration) in the setting of primary metabolic acidosis and a fruity breath odor.

Viruses, environmental (dietary) factors, and other stressors can trigger onset of disease due to autoimmune beta-cell destruction. More common in patients with northern european ancestry. Strong genetic predisposition, esp. in polymorphisms of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC or HLA). 

3 stages: **I** >= 2 pancreatic autoAb, **II** pancreatic autoAb and impaired fasting glucose (dysglemia) or impaired tolerance or A1c 5.7-6.4%, **III** hyperglycemia with clinical symptoms. A1c may be misleading in acute onset (esp. in pediatric) and glucose should be used instead.

Patients generally not obese and prone to other autoimmune diseases. 


**Type II**: reduced response to insulin (insulin resistance). Glucose can be stable as insulin production is increased to compensate. Primarily in obese or overweight patients with increased abdominal adipose tissue. See detailed description below.

**Gestational**: hyperglycemia first detected during pregnancy (typically 2nd or 3rd trimester). 

**Monogenic**: rare form of diabetes due to single gene mutations. Can present in infants < 6mo where T1D is very rare.
 
_Note_: Diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus and has nothing to do with the pancreas or blood sugar - it is a kidney urine concentrating issue.

## Type 2 Diabetes

#### Presentation of T2D
Patients may initially present with symptoms of hyperglycemia such as blurred vision, vulvovaginitis, pruritus, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as recurrent yeast infections. If insulin deficiency is more severe, fatigue / weakness, polyuria, polydipsia, and sometimes weight loss may present as symptoms. Diabetic ketoacidosis is rare. 

Some patients are relatively asymptomatic until chronic complications of diabetes develop. Prior to the initial diagnosis, all patients develop impaired glucose tolerance (normal <140mg/dL after 2 hours) or impaired fasting glucose (normal 60-100mg/dL).

In patients with known T1/2D, HbA1C is commonly used to measure treatment success. HbA1C measures nonreversible glycosylation of the hemoglobin molecule (expressed as a percentage of total hemoglobin), which is directly related to blood glucose concentrations. It reflects mean blood glucose values during a 2- to 3-month period and can be used as a predictor of a patient’s risk of microvascular complications. Typcial diagnostic ranges are <5.4% normal, 5.4-6.4% prediabetes, >6.5% diabetes.

#### The pancreas [[ref]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-pancreas) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459261/)
The pancreas is an elongated, tapered organ located across the back of the belly, behind the stomach. The right side of the organ—called the head—is the widest part of the organ and lies in the curve of the duodenum, the first division of the small intestine. The tapered left side extends slightly upward—called the body of the pancreas—and ends near the spleen—called the tail.

The pancreas has 2 tissue types:
 - **Exocrine**: secretes digestive enzymes. These enzymes are secreted into a network of ducts that join the main pancreatic duct. This runs the length of the pancreas.
 - **Endocrine**: consists of the islets of Langerhans and secretes hormones into the bloodstream. 5 endocrine cell types - alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and upsilon - which secrete glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide respectivley.
 
Particularly relevant to DM are the beta cells and insulin.

#### Insulin

**Synthesis**: mRNA translated to preproinsulin --> signal peptide removed at ER insertion generates proinsulin --> conversion to insulin in ER via exposure to endopeptidases excising C peptide --> secreted via exycytosis into islet capillary blood.

**MOA**: Insulin circulates unbound with T1/2 = 6min. it binds to hepatic, muscle, and adipocyte cells via specific receptor tyrosine kinase. This increases the kinase activity to phosphorylate regulatory enzymes and other protein substratses.

**Regulation**: plasma glucose is main regulator. Glucose taken up via GLUT2 transporter in beta cells increases cellular ATP and closes ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (KATP) channels in beta cell membrane causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx --> insulin secretion.

Plasma amino acids, free fatty acids, glucagon, and medications can also induce insulin secretion.

**Function**: Maintain glucose homeostasis via action in the liver (upregulate glucose --> glycogen: glycogenesis, and glucose --> triglycerides), in muscles (uptake and storage as glycogen), and in adipose tissue (uptake and conversion to triglycerides)

**Notes**: Amylin and the insulin C-peptide are co-secreted with insulin by beta cells. Amylin supresses glucagon from alpha cells and slows gastic emptying. C-peptide

### Treatment

Treatment generally has the glycemic goal of A1C < 7% along with blood pressure management which can be accomplished via several methods:

**Nutrition & Exercise**: Avoidance of weight gain, consistent carbohydrate intake. Weight loss mitigates insulin resistance and improves beta cell function. Sugary beverages are strongly discouraged. At least 150min of moderate aerobic exersize over at least 3 days is reccomended.

**Surgery**: weight loss surgery in obese patients is an effective option to treat T2D when other options have failed.

#### Pharmacologic therapy

Early treatment is indicated for improved long term management and should be used alongside above options.

**Metformin**: always a good start unless specifically contraindicated. Goal is to increase as tolerated to 2000mg daily. Promotes weight loss, has very few hypoglycemic events, and is cheap. Metformin is an insulin sensitizer, and does not activley change insulin secretion in the pancreas.

Metformin is contraindicated in patients with impaired kidneys, active/severe liver disease, alcohol abuse, risk of hypoperfusion, history of lactic acidosis with metformin, or decreased tissue perfusion/hemodynamic instability. Common side effects are GI upset.

_MOA_ [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2013.256): 

![Metformin MOA](assets/lib/img/metforminMOA.webp)


**Sulfonylureas**: insulin secretagogues. Inhibit ATPK activity in beta cells, increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and corresponding insulin release. Contraindicated with renal or hepatic impairment. Relativley cheap. Examples include glyburide, the medication taken by the patient in this case, and Chlorpropamide.

**Other medications** 
 - GLP-1 receptor agonist: synthetic gut-derived peptide hormones (incretin hormones). Trigger insulin release. Can help with weight loss. Favorable atherosclerotic and kidney outcomes. Can cause hypoglycemia.
 - DPP-4 inhibitors: inhibit enzyme which breaks down incretins leading to increased insulin secretion with very low hypoglycemic risk.
 - SGLT2 inhibitors: lower blood sugar by preventing kidney reabsorbtion. Can result in polyurea UTIs.
 - Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors: competitively blocks the enzyme alpha glucosidase in the brush borders of the small intestine, which delays absorption of carbohydrates.
 - Thiazolidinediones: insulin sensistizer. Can cause weight gain and peripheral edema. 
 
### Complications

#### Acute Complications

 - DKA: Insufficient insulin to provide glucose to cells for energy results in ketone metabolism, lowering blood pH. This causes dehydration and electrolyte deficiency. The patient presents with signs of dehydration, Kussmaul breath (deep, prolonged and sigh breathing) and acetone aspiration. Often, these signs are accompanied by diffuse abdominal pain. The level of consciousness is not affected initially, but then there may be a gradual decline in consciousness leading to sleepiness, lethargy and ultimately coma.
 - Hyperglycemia: Insufficient insulin results in high blood sugar. Manifests as increased thirst and a dry mouth, needing to pee frequently, tiredness and blurred vision.
 - Hypoglycemia: incorrect large dose of insulin, intense exercise, or reduced intake of food/carbohydrate. The patient has irritability and increased sweating while there may be disorders of the level of consciousness, loss of consciousness and/or coma. Immediate ingestion of glucose by mouth (sweets, sugary soft drinks, etc.) or, if the patient is unconscious, intravenous glucose administration is required. Symptoms include: increased sweating, blurred vision, trembling, headache or dizziness, paleness, irritability, tears, convulsions, distraction, clumsy moves, tingles around the mouth and intense desire to eat.
 
#### Chronic Complications

Most chronic complications are the result of long-term hyperglycemia. Increased blood glucose damages microvasculature in the eyes, kidneys, and nerves resulting in retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy respectivley. Some specific chronic complications include:

 - Macroangiopathy: serious heart and vascular lesions that lead to hypertension, artery narrowing, coronary artery disease, strokes and erectile dysfunction in men.
 - Diabetic retinopathy: serious deterioration of vision mainly due to damage to the vessels of the eye. It is the most common cause of blindness in the Western world.
 - Diabetic nephropathy: may result in renal insufficiency.
 - Diabetic neuropathy: sensory disturbances, muscle atrophy, walking difficulty, injuries with wound formation and intense pain at the lower extremities. Also responsible for tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea and / or constipation.
 - Diabetic foot: lesions observed on the diabetics at the region by the knees and below and are related to pain, sensory disorder, skin dryness, development of calluses, wounds and ulcers, often complicated by severe local infections and leading to the development of gangrene requiring amputation.
 - Vulnerability to infections, myopathy, osteoporosis, arthropathies and liver damage.

 
## Biopsychosocial factors

#### Building Trust
Ask about occupation and give patients the impression that you know some things about their case before you walk in. Acknowledge people in the room. Make sure patient feels free to ask questions and check in with understanding by having them teach back.

#### Food Deserts
Food deserts are areas where people have limited access to a variety of healthful foods. This may be due to having a limited income or living far away from sources of healthful and affordable food. Patients in food deserts are at higher risk of T2D and obesity. T2D patients living in food deserts generally have poorer glycemic control [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4218969/) and a higher risk of diabetic complications.

#### Poor adherence
Poor adherece is linked to patient forgetfulness, anxiety about treatment-associated adverse effects, low motivation due to a perceived lack of efficacy, poor health literacy and aversion to the health belief model, and stigmatization. Other factors that may play a role include high prescription costs and insufficient patient–provider or provider-provider communication. Scheudling errors for recurrent treatment can also delay or cause missed treatments.

#### Barriers to Treatment [[ref]](https://academic.oup.com/tbm/article/10/6/1390/5999802)

The most commonly reported barriers to MA across conditions were younger age, low education, low income, high medication cost, side effects, patient beliefs/perceptions, comorbidities, and poor patient–provider communication. Digitally delivered interventions including components such as medication and condition education, motivational interviewing (MI), and reinforcement and motivational messages led to improvements in MA.

#### Barriers to specialty care [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3752985/#:~:text=The%20most%20frequent%20barriers%20were,were%20associated%20with%20incomplete%20referral.)

Barriers include (in order of prevalance):
 - Leaving work or finding childcare
 - Transportation to specialist center
 - Low appointment availability
 - Comprehension of provider or lack of interpreters
 - Trouble finding office or bad hours
 - Insurance coverage (lack thereof or out of network)

The most significant indicators of a future incomplete visit are inconvenient hours, trouble finding the office, and trouble getting an appointment quickly. Patients experiencing multiple barriers less likley to complete visit. Poor, black, other minorities, and/or uninsured use less specialty care overall. 

#### Other risk factors
 - In individuals with diabetes, a current depressive
episode was related to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, higher waist circumference,
triglyceride levels and albumin to creatinine ratio, being
older and female, having lower education, financial
problems in the past year, and experiencing discrimination at work, home and school.
 - Native American, Black, Hispanic, PI, and Asian patients at higher rist of T2D. 
 - Patients who may become pregnant should be advised of potential adverse effects of the fetus.

## Referral to specialist and Motivational Interviewing (MI)

#### Referral best practices
_As a PCP_
1. Prepare patient: make sure they understand why referral is necessary and who is in charge of making appointment
2. Referral request: state clinical question and provide prior treatment, related imaging/tests, and urgency of referral.
3. Define specialty role: additional evaluation, procedure, complete transfer of care or co-management.
4. Ensure referral completed after appt. 

_As a specialist_

Review referral, ensure apointment is at appropriate time, provide clear reccomendation to patients, communicate your role and role of PCP back to PCP, and let PCP know if patient was not seen for any reason.

#### Motivational Interviewing

1. **Engaging**: This is the foundation of MI. The goal is to establish a productive working relationship through careful listening to understand and accurately reflect the person’s experience and perspective while affirming strengths and supporting autonomy.
2. **Focusing**: In this process an agenda is negotiated that draws on both the client and practitioner expertise to agree on a shared purpose, which gives the clinician permission to move into a directional conversation about change.
3. **Evoking**: In this process the clinician gently explores and helps the person to build their own “why” of change through eliciting the client’s ideas and motivations. Ambivalence is normalized, explored without judgement and, as a result, may be resolved. This process requires skillful attention to the person’s talk about change.
4. **Planning**: Planning explores the “how” of change where the MI practitioner supports the person to consolidate commitment to change and develop a plan based on the person’s own insights and expertise. This process  is optional and may not be required, but if it is the timing and readiness of the client for planning is important.

### Terms and Definitions
 - **Secretagogues**: molecules that increase insulin secretion from the pancreas. Include high plasma amino acid glucagon and medications such as sulfonylureas and glinides
