## Altered Mental Status in the Elderly

Altered mental status is a common chief complaint among older emergency department (ED) patients. Acute changes in mental status are more concerning and are usually secondary to delirium, stupor, and coma. These forms of acute brain dysfunction are commonly precipitated by an underlying medical illness that can be potentially life-threatening and are associated with a multitude of adverse outcomes. [[reff]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614410/)

The term “altered mental status” is vague and has several synonyms such as confusion, not acting right, altered behavior, generalized weakness, lethargy, agitation, psychosis, disorientation, inappropriate behavior, inattention, and hallucination. Delirium occurs over a period of hours and days, and its course tends to wax and wane throughout the day. In contrast to stupor and coma, however, some elements of the level and content of consciousness are maintained in patients with delirium. The degree of impairment in the level of consciousness can be variable, ranging from moderate sleepiness (RASS −3) to extreme combativeness (RASS +4)

## Polypharmacy

Polypharmacy, defined as regular use of at least five medications, is common in older adults and younger at-risk populations and increases the risk of adverse medical outcomes. There are several risk factors that can lead to polypharmacy. Patient-related factors include having multiple medical conditions managed by multiple subspecialist physicians, having chronic mental health conditions, and residing in a long-term care facility. Systems-level factors include poorly updated medical records, automated refill services, and prescribing to meet disease-specific quality metrics. Tools that help identify potentially inappropriate medication use include the Beers, STOPP (screening tool of older people's prescriptions), and START (screening tool to alert to right treatment) criteria, and the Medication Appropriateness Index. [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/0701/p32.html)

- **Negative patient factors**: Decreased QoL, increased mobility issues and mortality, higher risk of adverse drug events, diability, falls, frailty, inappropriate medication use, long-term care placement, and medication nonadherence. Also increased use of healthcare system.
- **Negative healthcare factors**: Decreased physician productivity, increased medication erros.

### Drugs leading to AMS in the case

* Carvedilol: a beta-blocker, can cause CNS side effects such as confusion, dizziness, and fatigue, which may contribute to AMS, especially in the elderly.
* Furosemide: a loop diuretic, can lead to electrolyte imbalances (such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia) and dehydration, both of which are common causes of AMS in the elderly.
* Carbidopa/Levodopa: this combination is used to treat Parkinson's disease but can cause side effects such as hallucinations, confusion, and cognitive impairment, which can contribute to AMS in the elderly.

### Risk factors and social determinants

Patients over 62, with cognitive or developmental impairments, frailty, lack of primary care physician, mental health conditions, multiple chronic conditions, or who are residing in a long-term care facility or seeing multiple specialists are at higher risk. Health care systems with poor medical record keeping, poor transitions of care, and automated refill systems are also contributors to polypharmacy.

### How to avoid polypharmacy interactions

Many guidelines exist that can help identify potentially inappropriate medications. In trials, explicit guidelines have shown greater success, likley due to less time and mental effort required by the physician. One such set of guidelines is known as Beers Criteria, which were recently updated in 2023 by the American Geriatrics Society [[ref]](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.18372).

To summarize, the reccomendations include the avoidance of:
- First-gen antihistamines: high anticholenergic activity with lower clearance at advanced age
- Nitrofuranoin should be avoided in low creatinine clearance or for long-term use
- **Cardiovascular Drugs**
    - Aspirin for primary prevention. It is indicated for secondary prevention but increased bleed risk does not outweigh primary prevention benefit
    - Warfarin for nonvalvular A-fib or VTE: DOACs are preferred
    - Rivaroxaban for long term-treatment: apixaban is generally preferred due to lower bleed risk
    - Dipyridamole: fall risk
    - Non-selective alpha-1 agents for HTN: Orthostatic hypotension, better agents
    - Central alpha agonists for HTN: high risk of adverse CNS and orthostasis
    - Nifedipeine: Avoid in elderly
    - Amiodarone: avoid for A-fib unless patient has heart failure or substantial LV hypertrophy
    - Dronedarone: avoid in permanent A-fib or recent decompensation
    - Digoxin: avoid for first line A-fib and HFrEF as better agents exist with lower toxic profile. Beware discontinuation withdrawl
- **CNS Drugs**
    - Antidepressants or antiparkinsonian agents with strong anticholenergic activity (amitryptaline, clomipramine, imipramine, benzoprine, trihexyphenidyl): more effetive and less sedating alternatives exist
    - Antipsychotics: avoid except in BPD, Parkinson disease sychosis, and ajunct in MDD or short term anti-emetic use due to high risk of stroke, progression to dementia, and general mortality
    - Barbituates
    - Benzos: high risk of cognitive issues, falls, motor vehicle crashes, and physical dependence. May be appropriate in some indications
    - Meprobamate and ergoloid mesylates
- **Endocrine**
    - Androgens: avoid unless confirmed hypogonasm with clinical symptoms due to cardiac and prostate issues
    - Estrogens: carciongenic. Vaginal gream or tablets are acceptable for managment of dyspareunia, recurrent UTI, and other vaginal symptoms
    - Sliding scale insulin: high risk of hypoglycemia regardless of care setting. Basal or long-acting insulin should always be used
    - Sulfonylureas: avoid unless there are barriers to safer and more effective agents. If absolutley necessary use short acting agents
    - Megestrol
    - Growth hormone
    - Desiccated thyroid: safter alternatives
- **GI/GU**
    - PPIs: risk of C. diff, pneumonia, GI malignancy, bone loss, fractures. Avoid prolonged use except in high-risk patients (oral corticosteroid/chronic NSAID, Barrett's, failure of H2-receptor trial)
    - Metoclopramide: tardive dyskenesia
    - GI antisposmodics with anticholenergic activity: atropine, dicylomine, scopolamine...
    - Oral mineral oil
    - Desmopressin: high hyponatrima risk, safer treatments for nocturia exist
- **Pain**
    - Non-COX-2-selective NSAIDS: increased GI bleed and peptic ulcer risk. If chronic use is necessary combine with PPI or misoprostol
    - Indomethacin and ketorolac: GI bleeding
    - Meperidine: Not effective at common dosages and high risk of delerium
    - Skeletal muscle relaxants (carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine): poor tolerance due to anticholenergic activity. Baclofen and tizanidine are OK due to necessity for spasticity but still have significant adverse effects

Some drug drug interactions listed in the criteria that should be avoided are:
- RAS inhibitors (ACEIs, ARBs, ARNIs, K-sparing diuretics) and another RAS agent: hyperkalemia
- Opioids and benzos: OD and adverse events
- Opioids and Gabapentin or pregabalin: sedation related death
- Anticholeinergic with another anticholinergic: generally number of anticholinergics should be minimized
- Combination of 3 or more of Antiepileptics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzos, Z-drugs, opioids, and skeletal muscle reactants: fall and fracture risk
- Lithium and ACEIs, ARBs, ARNIs, or loop diuretics due to Li toxicity
- Non-selective peripheral alpha-1 blocker and loop diuretic: urinary retention in older women
- Phenytoin and TMP-SMX: high risk of phenytoin toxicity
- Theophyilline and cimetidine or cipro: theophyiline toxicity
- Warfarin and any of amiodarone, cipro, macrolides (except azithromycin), TMP-SMX, or SSRIs: bleed risk

Successful deprescribing of medications on the AGS Beers Criteria involves much more than a clinician simply telling an older person to stop taking a medication. Communication gaps and misunderstandings, patient reluctance and fear of stopping, coordination among multiple clinicians, dosage tapering, withdrawal symptoms, and conveying stop orders to pharmacies are just some of the challenges that can arise.
