## Cerebral Vasculature

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Patients who have survived a previous event are at significant risk of a second event.

## Ischemic Stroke

Ischemic stroke, or infarction of the brain, spinal cord, or retina, represents over 70% of all stroke. Ischemic stroke resolving before premanat tissue damage is termed a transient ischemic attack (TIA). 

### Risk Factors

Non-modifiable risk factors include advanced age, male sex, and certain genetic factors wuch as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARDAISL). Modifiable risk factors include low physical activity, high ApoB-ApoA1 ratio, poor diet, high waist-to-hip ratio, stress and depression, smoking, cardiac issues (A-fib and previous MI), high alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, and most prominently, self-reported hypertension or blood pressure over 160/90.

#### Nicotine [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016561470201893X)

The best characterized site of action of nicotine is the nAChR (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor), the prototypical ligand-gated ion channel. nAChRs are pentamers of a variety of subunits found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems and most of the physiological effects of nicotine studied are attributed to activation of nAChRs.

Nicotine has numerous detrimental effects on blood vessels in the brain. Endothelial components affected by nicotine include mediators of thrombosis [e.g. plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)] and leukocyte migration (e.g. P-selectin and CD18). Nicotine might also have adverse effects on the integrity and function of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and interfere with the regulation of blood flow.

Smoking itself is a much greater risk factor than nicotine alone [[ref]](https://watermark.silverchair.com/eurjpc0207.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA2QwggNgBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggNRMIIDTQIBADCCA0YGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMF4sUdclInyttIm5vAgEQgIIDF-Ff2yEo5dwWcEfDBr0NuEl751W8IbnlXGlzW3zE-KEBOxCwkQMd7434joIGpMuaiuE8jwiz8xiONHiu2AGU2sCMH58ogPg3Jgh7EK6_ghx-QuJfGCMP7qYZUOudxIUiKvdRu-JpuitpyUdS1cM7KWs1blK7eU6zszvodlyCU4nkEq4QSRzkEm4Bxt5keH8p7_Y2MujB1HaDGAXiDH4xTizSfp2a3BvpCjiKvFfb_J9gzE8ZPOaq8Mj9akBZ1O7XLyJe4CPtklGPlv5Q8CR_0IyaKb-8aiIR8Dn1kkM5W2ddIwzMbNPZiIcN4rrU1kabelP0mKnH4RFORNXpl-L8FsYCEVXbePGuPxVsmDgBUxuCspcqVY1CImFz-E-FCFjjxuU5NGYFZNpt6xQsIqKoNG759RijbgUjrjlvdRZAZxDxoE-xVJKIabaogzra_Krz_uHb4xZv7nyA2RSds5ASj7NWyawSteWZBC4KAd3nMEISIBKS8yonfllJHjHV7dip2eq8xNj92EDA2T2GYU9CeIP7EU0y1xwaRBn7QNx2PeP42EhQtG21qBYMsWXk41vqrVKCuMcQkB6t19IJx0Lb9XVCIbqug32OEwFQGIsJ6nayVHcvnbAjYU_BvzSnuR20DKqPP6X6LvpiBUo7mS-XEQAjDKIViFOa0F17ZqxYhmlbet1muEdIg5n4np7QCrSctCAg4eV3wsJ6ZrH64FvKmG_oHNN7zaY1qo7PNxDv14ZrXRGERP7HopfuNVtu4NOJcBdvTedvMHJEx7uUtmeJKkscM8iGQMnaV_ezb-ZMLy47yZGrf1i_554HOBv03ExVF1Lo2Ec3xG8U1y7UNtpVO0nBYVKDpyWmxGniKXLsfC_zFx9viH4NJTjzi1WejsN7LNrIVCwp5EIfsYrs-gD2CVoz17lVUe4OmHo8xw1gEP4pxQ8H8GSa9PGWVYsvJY8cJbeSofv_kme1ZMDZqCOU60QJmTPLQpqKqFiF7xGtEYpbBf-F3LNpO1ZWCpKHS7-ack9-GI-YlAlBVKZHvilw8jnDB4dYcb_f). Light smokers have approximatley 2.5 fold risk, while heavy smokers have up to 4 times baseline risk. This is due to a variety of reasons including increased rate of atherosclerosis in the carotid artieries.

### Pathophysiology

Most ischemic strokes are thromboembolic. Atherosclerotic emboli from the aortic arch, carotids, or intracranial vessels are a common site of origin. The most common site of plaques causing stroke is the internal carotid after its bifurcation from the common carotid.

Small vessel disease in the vessels originating from the circle of willis is another cause of ischemic stroke, traditionally lacunar infarcts. Dissection in intimal arterial layers with intramural thrombus is a particularly important cause of strokes in young patients, and often occurs in the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. Vasculitis is an uncommon cause.

![Stroke Etiologies](/img/stroke_causes.png)

A variety of mechanisms can result in ischemic stroke from cardiac causes:
- A-fib: stagnation of blood in the L-atrial appendage allows thromboembolism to cerebral circulation. Patients should be considered for prophylactic anticoagulation
- PFO: especially relevant in young patients, PFO allows embolism from the venous system to travel across the atria into cerebral circulation (known as a paradoxical embolism)
- Infective Endocarditis: septic emboli are problematic as emboli can cause septic arteritis increasing risk of secondary cerebral hemorrhage.
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy: similar etiology as A-fib.

Finally, hematological disorders that isncrease clotting can result in ischemic stroke, often via occlusion of cerebral venins. These are summarized in the above table.

### Stroke Alert System

IV thrombolysis within 4.5h of onset reduces disability, and some patients with favorable imaging may benefit up to 9h following symptom onset or after wake-up onset. Endovascular thrombectomy is another treatment class with a slightly longer window for treatment: best outcomes occur if thrombectomy is performed within 6h but there may be benefit in select patients for up to 24h. 

#### Tele-Neurology

In telestroke medicine — also called stroke telemedicine — health care providers who have advanced training in treating strokes can use technology to treat people who've had strokes in another location. These stroke experts work with local emergency health care providers to recommend a diagnosis and treatment.

### Diagnostic Imaging [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0118-8)

- **CT**: Non-contrast CT of the brain has close to 100% sensitivity for the detection of intraparenchymal and extra-axial (within the skull but outside the parenchyma) haemorrhage. Traditionally, a CT brain scan excluding haemorrhage in a patient with clinical signs of a stroke has formed the basis of thrombolysis treatment decision making. In some patients it is possible to make a positive diagnosis of stroke based on early ischaemic changes such as loss of grey matter–white matter differentiation.
- **CTA**: CT angiography is highly accurate for the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusion, and, therefore, can diagnose ischaemic stroke and provide insights into the mechanism of stroke if atherosclerosis or arterial dissection are identified. CT angiography should be routinely acquired from the aortic arch to the cerebral vertex in all patients with ischaemic stroke to assess eligibility for endovascular thrombectomy if this treatment is an option on site or via a transfer elsewhere. In addition, CT angiography can be used to assess the extent of collateral flow, which provides additional prognostic information about the likely extent of tissue injury. CTA may underestimate the extent of collateral perfusion due to the timing of contrast, excluding patients who may otherwise benefit from thrombectomy.
- **MRI**: Diffusion MRI assesses the random motion of water molecules and is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of acute ischaemia. Diffusion is restricted in regions of cytotoxic edema, where there is a shift in water distribution from extracellular to intracellular compartments. Diffusion MRI becomes abnormal within minutes of ischaemic stroke onset, and regions with diffusion restriction rarely return to an entirely normal radiological or histological appearance. Over the next few hours, further blood–brain barrier injury leads to ionic and vasogenic oedema, which is visible on T2-based MRI sequences and non-contrast CT.

### Treatment

- **Pharmocologic Options**
    - Antiplatlet therapy (e.g. aspirin) given within 48 hr greatley reduces risk of recurrent stroke. 
    - **TPA**: alteplase is recombinant tPA cleaving plasminogen to plasmin which in turn cleaves the thrombus. It is administered as a bolus follwed by 1hr infusion, optimally within 3hr but with optential benefit for up to 6hr. The commonly used window is 4.5hr. Perfusion imaging demonstrating salvegable brain may be used to extend this window. 
    - **Tenecteplase**: tenecteplase is genetically modified tPA with a longer half-life with greater fibrin specificity and resistance to inhibitors, and is now the standard thrombolytic for MI without available PCI. The drug is not liscenced in the US, but has been shown to be superior to alteplase in several recent trials.
- **Surgical Removal**
    - **Interventional catheterization**: endovascular thrombectomy has demonstrated benefit up to 24 hr after onset provided imaging indicates salvageable brain tissue. There are few contraindications and endovascular thrombectomy can be performed in patients ineligeble for tPA. Typical approaches include the combination of a stent retriever and aspiration catheter without placement of a stent. Typically, endovascular approaches follow tPA by a matter of minutes to hours if they must be transferred (drip and ship)

### Management

Complications including edema (peaking 3-5d after onset) can cause brainstem herniation and death and may require craniectomy. Cerebellar infarcts and MCA infarcts are most common causes of severe cerebral edema. DVT and aspiration pneumonia are some other major issues which may be offset with LMWH and swallow screen.

- Telemetry and Blood Pressure: acute intensive BP lowering is not beneficial and may be harmful if collateral blood flow is compromised. However, following acute control HTN management is essential. 
- Cardiac evaluation (Watchman device)
- Lifestyle modification: smoking cessation, lowering salt intake, weight loss, and increased exercise are primary targets.
- Pharmacologic intervention: aspirin or clopidogrel are the most common antiplatelet therapies for stroke prevention. Depending on the patient, continuation past 3 weeks may have bleed risk outweight by stroke benefit and should usually be replaced by DOACs.
- Surgical: carotid stenosis >70% in symptomatic patients benefits from endarterectomy and the procedure may be beneficial in slect patients with 50-70% stenosis. Asymptomatic stenosis is thought to be best managed medically. Closure of PFO has benefit over pure medical therapy.

### Recovery

Much recovery following stroke is due to neuroplasticity (that is, the ability to leverage alternate pathways to replace those lost due to stroke). This plasticity might involve local sprouting, synaptogenesis or simply the strengthening of transmission at existing synapses. Importantly, this plasticity seems to come at some cost; it is very common for younger patients to experience very good physical recovery but be left with problems attending to simultaneous events and of fatigue. Imaging studies suggest that to function normally they need to recruit much larger, more diffuse networks, and that this comes at a cost of effort and of the ability to deploy these networks in other tasks. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0118-8)

Recovery is often documented via mRS score:
* 0 - The patient has no residual symptoms.
* 1 - The patient has no significant disability; able to carry out all pre-stroke activities.
* 2 - The patient has slight disability; unable to carry out all pre-stroke activities but able to look after self without daily help.
* 3 - The patient has moderate disability; requiring some external help but able to walk without the assistance of another individual.
* 4 - The patient has moderately severe disability; unable to walk or attend to bodily functions without assistance of another individual.
* 5 - The patient has severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, requires continuous care.
* 6 - The patient has expired (during the hospital stay or after discharge from the hospital).
* 7 - Unable to contact patient/caregiver.
* 8 - Modified Rankin Score not performed, OR unable to determine (UTD) from the medical record documentation.

## Hemorrhagic Stroke

Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage can be primary or secondary to a variety of causes including cerebral venous thrombosis, rupture of congenital vascular or dural ateriovenous fistular malformations, CNS vasculitis, or ischemic stroke. Mass effect and elevated ICP lead to significantly higher fatality than ischemic stroke. 

### Risk Factors

Below the age of 40, the most common causes of ICH are vascular malformations, cerebral venous thrombosis, sympathomimetic drug use, eclampsia, hypertension, and cryptogenic. Smoking, hematologic disorders, and extremes in BMI are associated with ICH. Above the age of 40, hypertension is the most-common cause, with rising proportions due to amyoloid angiopathy past the age of 60.

### Pathophysiology

Spontaneous ICH is most associated with fibrohyaline replacement of SM in the tunica media (Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (deposition of amyloid-b).

### Treatment 

Decompressive surgery should be offered as soon as possible in patients with cerebellar hemorrhages 3 cm or greater, with evidence of brainstem compression, or with hydrocephalus, and in deteriorating patients with supratentorial hemorrhage.

### Mesolimbic System (ML-DA) and Addiction [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2238694/)

#### Anatomy 

![Mesolimbic](/img/mesolymbic.jpg)

* Midbrain: VTA = ventral tegmental area
* Diencephalon: LH = lateral hypothalamus, LMB = lateral mammillary body
* Basal forebrain: Nacc = nucleus accumbens, VP = ventral pallidum, OT = olfactory tubercle, CeA = central nucleus of amygdala, MeA = medial nucleus of the amygdala, BNST = bed nucleus of stria terminalis, LS = lateral septum.
* Higher forebrain: pFC = prefrontal cortex, ACC = anterior cingulated cortex, BLA = basolateral amygdala, HC = hippocampal complex.

#### Physiology [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137256/)

The ML-DA system has been implicated in addiction, ADHD, depression, and compulsive disorders due to its role in positive reward states and appetitive motivated behavior. In mammals, most DA-containing neurons clustered within three major mesencephalic groups: A8 cells in the retrorubral field, A9 cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and A10 cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The ML-DA system is unique in that it is the only dopaminergic pathway that transmits all the way to the frontal cortex rather than simply the basal ganglia. 

The addictive properties of nicotine are thought to originate via activation of nAChR on dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic pathway. One of the most direct and important neuroadaptations induced by chronic nicotine use is the subtype-specific upregulation of nAChRs, as nicotine is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholine esterase thus favoring desesitazation. This results in withdrawl when nicotine is no longer present and endogenous ACh can no longer stimulate receptors at a baseline level. Chronic nicotine exposure also has indirect effects on motivational systems by altering synthesis and release of opioid peptides in a time-dependent and peptide-specific fashion.

Withdrawl symptoms include dysphoria, anxiety, and irratability. HPA axis dysregulation causes elevted corticosterone and CRF.

## Case Medications

* **tPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)**:
  - Mechanism of Action: tPA is a thrombolytic agent that activates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots.
  - Indications: Acute ischemic stroke, with administration within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.
  - Use in Stroke Treatment/Prevention: tPA is the primary treatment for acute ischemic stroke, as it can dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the affected brain region.

* **Varenicline**:
  - Mechanism of Action: Varenicline is a partial agonist of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation by partially displacing nicotine at its site of action.
  - Indications: Smoking cessation.
  - Use in Stroke Prevention: Smoking is a major risk factor for stroke, and quitting smoking with the help of varenicline can significantly reduce the risk of stroke.

* **Atorvastatin**:
  - Mechanism of Action: Atorvastatin is a statin drug that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to reduced LDL-cholesterol levels.
  - Indications: Hyperlipidemia, prevention of cardiovascular events.
  - Use in Stroke Prevention: Atorvastatin can help lower the risk of ischemic stroke by reducing LDL-cholesterol levels and improving endothelial function.

* **Lisinopril**:
  - Mechanism of Action: Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation and reduced blood pressure.
  - Indications: Hypertension, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy.
  - Use in Stroke Prevention: Lisinopril can help prevent stroke by effectively lowering blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

* **Apixaban**:
  - Mechanism of Action: Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that prevents the formation of thrombin, thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis.
  - Indications: Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism.
  - Use in Stroke Prevention: Apixaban is used to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, a significant risk factor for stroke.
