## Cerebral Vasculature

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Patients who have survived a previous event are at significant risk of a second event.

## Ischemic Stroke

Ischemic stroke, or infarction of the brain, spinal cord, or retina, represents over 70% of all stroke. Ischemic stroke resolving before premanat tissue damage is termed a transient ischemic attack (TIA). 

### Risk Factors

Non-modifiable risk factors include advanced age, male sex, and certain genetic factors wuch as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARDAISL). Modifiable risk factors include low physical activity, high ApoB-ApoA1 ratio, poor diet, high waist-to-hip ratio, stress and depression, smoking, cardiac issues (A-fib and previous MI), high alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, and most prominently, self-reported hypertension or blood pressure over 160/90.

### Pathophysiology

Most ischemic strokes are thromboembolic. Atherosclerotic emboli from the aortic arch, carotids, or intracranial vessels are a common site of origin. The most common site of plaques causing stroke is the internal carotid after its bifurcation from the common carotid.

Small vessel disease in the vessels originating from the circle of willis is another cause of ischemic stroke, traditionally lacunar infarcts. Dissection in intimal arterial layers with intramural thrombus is a particularly important cause of strokes in young patients, and often occurs in the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. Vasculitis is an uncommon cause.

A variety of mechanisms can result in ischemic stroke from cardiac causes:
- A-fib: stagnation of blood in the L-atrial appendage allows thromboembolism to cerebral circulation. Patients should be considered for prophylactic anticoagulation
- PFO: especially relevant in young patients, PFO allows embolism from the venous system to travel across the atria into cerebral circulation (known as a paradoxical embolism)
- Infective Endocarditis: septic emboli are problematic as emboli can cause septic arteritis increasing risk of secondary cerebral hemorrhage.
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy: similar etiology as A-fib.

Finally, hematological disorders that isncrease clotting can result in ischemic stroke, often via occlusion of cerebral venins. These are summarized in the above table.

### Time to Treatment

IV thrombolysis within 4.5h of onset reduces disability, and some patients with favorable imaging may benefit up to 9h following symptom onset or after wake-up onset. Endovascular thrombectomy is another treatment class with a slightly longer window for treatment: best outcomes occur if thrombectomy is performed within 6h but there may be benefit in select patients for up to 24h. 

## Hemorrhagic Stroke

Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage can be primary or secondary to a variety of causes including cerebral venous thrombosis, rupture of congenital vascular or dural ateriovenous fistular malformations, CNS vasculitis, or ischemic stroke. Mass effect and elevated ICP lead to significantly higher fatality than ischemic stroke. 

### Risk Factors

Below the age of 40, the most common causes of ICH are vascular malformations, cerebral venous thrombosis, sympathomimetic drug use, eclampsia, hypertension, and cryptogenic. Smoking, hematologic disorders, and extremes in BMI are associated with ICH. Above the age of 40, hypertension is the most-common cause, with rising proportions due to amyoloid angiopathy past the age of 60.

### Pathophysiology

Spontaneous ICH is most associated with fibrohyaline replacement of SM in the tunica media (Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (deposition of amyloid-b).

### Treatment 

Decompressive surgery should be offered as soon as possible in patients with cerebellar hemorrhages 3 cm or greater, with evidence of brainstem compression, or with hydrocephalus, and in deteriorating patients with supratentorial hemorrhage.
