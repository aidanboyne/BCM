## Pathophysiology

### DVT

DVT occurs when a blood clot occurs in the "deep veins" (popliteal, femoral, or iliac) of the legs, thighs, or pelvis - proximal DVT. If part or all of the thrombus breaks off, it can cause pulmonary embolism (PE). Can also occur in peroneal, posterior, anterior tibial, and muscular veins of calf (distal DVT) with lower risk of PE. In this case, the DVT in left femoral vein is known as an illiofemoral DVT which is associated with higher PE risk and higher reoccurrence.

DVT are more common after inactivity or immobilization. Cancer, old age, previous DVT/PE, obesity, pregnancy, smoking, heart failure, kidney issues, some medications, and recent surgery all increase DVT risk. People with inherited or acquired thrombophilia are also at higher risk.

Generally look for increased clotting risk: Virchow's triad for clot risk includes intravascular vessel wall damage, stasis of flow, and the presence of a hypercoagulable state.

#### Symptoms and testing

Swelling, warmth, pain, and tenderness to the tough in the affected leg. Weekly compression ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice, but d-dimer (>500 ng/mL) or MRI/CT may also be used. In positive DVT, vein will not compress with pressure under ultrasound.

#### Treatment

 - Anticoagulants: LMW Heparin, unfractionated heparin (in dialysis patients), or fondaparinux are first line treatments used for 5-10d. This is usually followed by long term antigoagulation for 3-12mo via warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs i.e. factor Xa inhibitors Eliquis, Xarelto) help prevent new clots. People with unknown cause or multiple episodes may continue anticoagulation indefinitely.
 - Walking helps patient feel better faster after symptoms under control with anticoagulation.
 - In life-threatening cases, "clot-busting" thyrombolytic drugs are used to dissolve the blood clots, ideally immediately after diagnosis. 
 - Inferior vena cava filter can be used in high bleed risk patients to prevent PE, but can increase long term risk.

Patients with >13% risk of bleed should not be anticoagulated.


### Cellulitis

Cellulitis is bacterial infection of the epidermis and dermis. Erysipelas is similar, but only infects superficial skin layers and usually can be distinguished due to clearly demarcated raised border. Look for peau d'orange (skin that has orange-peel texture) to differentiate with DVT. However, note peau d'orange on breast can indicate breast cancer.

#### Symptoms
- Fever with chills and sweating
- Fatigue
- Pain or tenderness in the affected area
- Skin redness or inflammation that gets bigger as the infection spreads
- Skin sore or rash that starts suddenly, and grows quickly in the first 24 hours
- Tight, glossy, stretched appearance of the skin
- Warm skin in the area of redness
- Muscle aches and joint stiffness from swelling of the tissue over the joint
- Nausea and vomiting

#### Treatment
Always cover beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, the most common pathogens. MRSA should be suspected in patients with prior exposure, immunocompromised patients or those with systemic signs of toxicity and/or drainage/exudate.
- Uncomplicated patients can be treated with oral abx such as Dicloxacillin or Cefadroxil. Higher risk patients can be treated with parenteral abx such as Cefazolin or Nafcillin.
- For immunocompromised or septic patients, intravenous vancomycin plus cefepime every eight hours is recommended. In suspected MRSA, TMP-SMX and Amoxicillin plus doxycycline is recommended.



## Pharmacology

#### Anticoagulants
Anticoagulants inhibit the coagulation pathway as shown below:
![Anticoagulant](/img/ThrombosisInhibitors.png)

#### Thrombolytics
Thrombolytics directly bind to fibrin proteins in the clot and preferentially act on fibrin-bound plasminogen; convert plasminogen into its active form, plasmin, which cuts the fibrin into smaller pieces and dissolves the clot.

#### Beta-Lactam Antibiotics
This class of abx is characterized by their highly reactive 3-carbon and 1-nitrogen ring (beta-lactam ring). Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the last step in peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating the transpeptidase involved in cross-linking peptides to form peptidoglycan. The targets for the actions of beta-lactam antibiotics are known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This binding, in turn, interrupts the terminal transpeptidation process and induces loss of viability and lysis, also through autolytic processes within the bacterial cell.


## Clinical

### Post-surgical exam and concerns

Patients are monitored to reduce the frequency of complications based on the assumption that physiologic vital sign abnormalities such as tachycardia, hypotension, and desaturation precede adverse events before becoming clinically evident. Opposed to manual interval tracking (track and trigger), continuous monitoring is superior in detecting abnormal vital signs.

Findings suggest that analyzing vital sign data as cumulative durations or frequencies below thresholds is too simplistic, but can predict SAEs to some degree [[ref]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630918). AI based approaches (SVM models) have shown promise in SAE prediction. However, a substantial proportion of patients with severe episodes of abnormal vital signs also have a high frequency of self‐limiting episodes [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9310747/).

#### Normal Vitals Review
 - Temperature: 35.3 – 37.7 C (95.5 – 99.9 F) orally
 - Heart rate: 60* to 90-100 / min (Bates)
 - Blood pressure: Systolic ~90-120 / diastolic ~50-80 mmHg
 - Respiratory rate: 12-24 / min
 - Oxygen saturation: >95% while breathing ambient air

Bacterial infection can cause a change in vitals. Tachycardia and tachypnea are the most sensitive and specific in predicting serious bacterial infections, while high temperature, severe hypoxemia and hypotension are the least sensitive but highly specific signs of serious bacterial infections. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949796/).

#### Post-op red flags
 - **Tachycardia >100 bpm**
 - Pain, Hypovolemia (dry, bleeding), Arrythmia
 - **Hypotension <100/60**
 - Hypovolemia, drugs, epidural, MI, PTX, normal?
 - Low urinary output
 - Increased RR or WOB, decreased RR or not breathing
 - Sats < 92% on 3‐4 liters, or rising oxygen requirement
 - Hypertension >160
 - Delirium

General idea is to check for complaints, pain control, nausea, vomiting, tolerating diet. Monitor any lines and medications. Also ask if they've been urinating. Check if thy have been out of bed and give focused physical exam depending on surgical site. Always check mental status, heart, lungs, operative site, drains.

Make sure to coordinate well with care team: nurses, therapists, etc. Good relationships ensure rapid communication of results and higher quality patient care.

#### Recovery Process
**Immediate Postoperative Phase**:
 - Begins in the recovery room or post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) immediately after surgery.
 - Focuses on stabilization, pain management, and monitoring of vital signs.
 - Assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status is critical.
 - Intravenous fluids and medications are administered as needed.
 - Early ambulation and deep breathing exercises may be initiated to prevent complications like atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis.

**Acute Phase**:
 - Lasts from the initial recovery to several days after surgery.
 - Inflammation and wound healing processes are prominent during this phase.
 - Patient's pain is managed with a multimodal approach, combining opioids and non-opioid analgesics.
 - Wound care involves monitoring for signs of infection, promoting adequate blood flow, and facilitating healing.
 - Patients are gradually advanced to a regular diet and encouraged to maintain proper hydration.
 - Physical therapy interventions may begin, depending on the procedure, to prevent muscle atrophy and joint stiffness.

**Rehabilitative Phase**:
 - Occurs days to weeks after surgery, focusing on functional recovery and rehabilitation.
 - Emphasis is on enhancing mobility, strength, and restoring preoperative function.
 - Controlled and guided exercise programs are tailored to the specific surgical procedure and patient's condition.
 - Progression is individualized, balancing the need for healing and preventing complications.
 - Gradual return to work and activities of daily living is facilitated, considering the patient's overall health status.

### Misdiagnosis and cognitive bias

Leading questions can inject physician bias into patient answers and can lead patients toward the diagnosis the provider "wants" which may or may not be correct.

Misdiagnosis is a large problem, a 2020 study found that diagnostic error (false negative) rates ranged from 2.2% (myocardial infarction) to 62.1% (spinal abscess), with a median of 13.6% [interquartile range (IQR) 9.2-24.7] and an aggregate mean of 9.7% (PPR 8.2-12.3). Serious misdiagnosis-related harm rates per incident disease case ranged from 1.2% (myocardial infarction) to 35.6% (spinal abscess), with a median of 5.5% (IQR 4.6-13.6) and an aggregate mean of 5.2% (PPR 4.5-6.7) [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412440/).

Missed vascular events, infections, and cancers (sometimes collectively referred to as the “Big Three”) account for most of the morbidity and mortality attributable to diagnostic errors. These errors not only lead to poor outcomes but also reduce patient trust in healthcare system.

A variety of cognitive biases play a large part in misdiagnosis: ‘Our propensity for certain types of error is the price we pay for the brain's remarkable capacity to think and act intuitively’. These biases are summarized and exemplified in images from Neale et al. shown below: [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5873736/)

![Cognitive biases steps](/img/CogBias1.jpg)
Major takeaways are 
 - Confirmation Bias: selective gathering and interpretation of evidence consistent with current beliefs and the neglect of evidence that contradicts them
 - Anchoring: prioritizing information and data that support their initial impressions
 - Affect Heuristic: context or patient specific and can manifest when physicians label patients as “complainers” or when they experience positive or negative feelings toward a patient
 - Outcome bias: practice of believing that good or bad results are always attributable to prior decisions, even when there is no valid reason to do so

![Cognitive biases case study](/img/CogBias2.jpg)

Interruptions can also lead to errors - Flynn et al. found that interruptions during drug dispensing increased the error rate by 3.42%. Sevdalis et al. found that surgical team members perceived patient-related disruptions contributed most to errors (p < 0.01). Wiegmann et al. found a linear relationship between surgical flow disruptions and errors; as the number of disruptions increased, so did the number of errors (r = .47, p < 0.05) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3007093/).

Reflection (guided or self) is key to overcoming bias.
1. Physicians must fully appreciate the contribution of cognitive biases to errors in medical decision making
2. They must recognize that such errors are not inevitable
3. They must be optimistic that solutions to reduce bias work

Not all heuristics are necessarily negative, however. Heuristics offers the advantage of producing fast decisions and are especially useful when decision-making is highly time-dependent i.e., in the clinical setting where timely decisions are frequent. Still, overuse of heuristics can result in patient harm and error if not applied in the correct setting.

In the case of error, the general guidelines are to inform the patient:
 - Begin by stating there has been an error
 - Describe the course of events, using nontechnical language
 - State the nature of the mistake, consequences, and corrective action
 - Express personal regret and apologize
 - Elicit questions or concerns and address them
 - Plan the next step and next contact with the patient

It's important to tailor the response to each patient - it is usually good to involve supervisors and certain cases require the involvement of risk management.
