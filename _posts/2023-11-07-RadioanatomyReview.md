# Radioanatomy review

## Imaging Modalities

a. Different Imaging Modalities and Basics:
   - **Plain Film (X-ray)**: Uses ionizing radiation to create 2D images. Good for visualizing bones and dense tissues.
   - **CT (Computed Tomography)**: Combines X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images. Useful for various anatomical structures.
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate high-resolution images. Excellent for soft tissue and neurological imaging.
   - **Ultrasound**: Employs high-frequency sound waves to produce real-time images. Suitable for examining soft tissues and the cardiovascular system.
   - **Nuclear Medicine**: Involves radioactive tracers to create images of tissue function. Valuable for assessing metabolic activity.

b. **Contrast agents** (iodinated for CT, gadolinium for MRI) enhance vascular and tissue visibility, aiding in the detection of abnormalities.
- Type of contrast used for CT vs MRI:
   - **CT**: Iodinated contrast agents.
   - **MRI**: Gadolinium-based contrast agents.

c. Differences between normal PA and AP X-ray:
   - **PA (Posteroanterior)** X-ray is the standard, with the X-ray source behind the patient, minimizing radiation exposure. 
   - **AP (Anteroposterior)** X-ray involves the X-ray source in front, used in emergencies, but with increased radiation exposure. Also may magnify certain structures, especially the heart

### Contraindications and Patient Safety

- **CT with Contrast**: Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
- **MRI with Contrast**: Should be avoided in patients with severe renal dysfunction or gadolinium allergies. Assess renal function before administration.

### 3. Imaging Orientations

- **Coronal**: Imaging plane divides the body into front and back sections.
- **Axial**: Images are obtained parallel to the body's long axis, dividing it into upper and lower portions.
- **Sagittal**: Images are taken perpendicular to the body's long axis, dividing it into left and right sides.

### 4. Describing Dark or Light Structures

- Radiopaque/radiolucent: CXR, CT
- Hyperdense/hypodense: CT
- Hyperintense/hypointense: MRI
- Hyperechoic/hypoechoic/anechoic: Ultrasound
- Increased/decreased uptake or "avidity": PET or SPECT (nuclear medicine)

### 5. Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Comparing Modalities**: Consider factors like cost, time, and what is visualized well/poorly. CT is fast and useful for bone imaging. MRI is excellent for soft tissue evaluation but takes more time.

### 6. Ionizing Radiation and Alternative Imaging

- **Patients to Avoid Ionizing Radiation**: Pregnant individuals and children should minimize exposure. Alternative modalities like ultrasound or MRI should be considered.

## Common Clinical "Next Best Step"

- Hypotension in patient with trauma: FAST ultrasound (assess bleeding into body cavities), potentially followed by CT.
- RUQ pain: Abdominal ultrasound or CT (looking for gallstones, cholecystitis, fatty liver).
- RLQ pain: CT for suspected appendicitis (could also be Crohn's or duodenal atresia double bubble).
- Testicular/ovarian pain: Doppler ultrasound for torsion or cysts.
- Initial imaging for suspected stroke: Non-contrast CT (don't want to use contrast if hemorrhagic). For ischemic stroke, MRI.
- Asymptomatic patient with gallstones: No further imaging required.
- Female patient with lower abdominal pain: Pelvic ultrasound or transvaginal ultrasound. May also use hysterosalpingogram if we have infertility and suspected tubal occlusion.

## Identifying Anatomy and Pathology

a. **Anatomy**:
   - Cross-sectional: Liver, stomach, spleen, aorta vs IVC, pancreas, small intestine, muscles, pulmonary arteries, bladder.
   - Angiography: Humeral circumflex artery, brachial artery.
   - MRI: ACL, PCL, femur, tibia, fibula.
   - Ultrasound: Endometrial stripe, bladder, myometrium, ovary.
   - Head CT: Lateral ventricles, choroid plexus, brainstem, caudate, pineal gland, vertebral body levels.

### 9. MRI Sequences on Brain Imaging

- **T1-weighted**: Demonstrates anatomy well, with fat appearing bright.
- **T2-weighted**: Highlights fluid, making it useful for detecting lesions.
- **FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery)**: Suppresses cerebrospinal fluid, enhancing lesion visibility.

### 10. Layers Pierced During Lumbar Puncture

During a lumbar puncture, you pass through the following layers sequentially:
1. Skin
2. Subcutaneous tissue
3. Supraspinous ligament
4. Interspinous ligament
5. Ligamentum flavum
6. Epidural space
7. Dura mater (arachnoid included)
8. Subarachnoid space

# Urologic Diagnostics Notes

## Urinalysis

**Dipstick** - chemical analysis
- Blood: hemeoglobin and myoglobin
- Nitrite: certain bacteria
- Leukocyte esterase: WBC chemical
- Not super reliable

**Microscopy**
- WBC = inflammation
- RBC = bleeding
- Bacteria = bacteriuria (asymptomatic, especially in catheters, stents) v. infection (symptomatic)
- Squamous cells = probably contaminated sample

Confirm kidney stone with CT no contrast taken prone to allow passed stone to settle in anterior bladder. Stones are radiodense on CT. 

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (go straight through kidney for large staghorn calculus). 

24 hour urine collection
- Volume, pH, electrolytes, etc...
- Tailor dietary recommendations or offer medications based on results

In children we usually use an ultrasound. Good visualization of the kidney. Air and fat are sonodense, fluid is sonolucent, and kidney stones and bone are sonodense with shadowing.

Hydronephrosis without clear obstruction should be examined via nuclear medicine renal scan (functional imaging where we track tracer over time). NOTE: right side of image is right side of patient (NOT FLIPPED!)
- DTPA & Mag 3: filtered substances that show kidney perfusion and differential kidney function
- DMSA: accumulates in corex to show scarring or infarction
- Mag 3: Excreted into urine and can show urinary tract obstruction

Pyeloplasty: take out narrowed segment between renal pelvis and ureter at UPJ and replace with reconnect it

Urine cytology: microscopic urine analysis by cytologist. See high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, irregular membranes, coarse chromatin, mitiotic figures, eccentric nucleoli, etc. in cancer cells.

CT Urogram: Delayed CT imaging 10 minutes after the administration of IV contrast. Contrast is excreted into urine and we can ID urothelial lesions as filling defects.

Cytoscopy: camera inserted via ureter, you can resect the tumor. Be careful about the obturator nerve which can cause kick reflex if you hit it with electrocautery as it sits along the wall of the bladder. To check for bladder perforation, use cystogram.

Cystogram: contrast injection via foley catheter. Sagital view neded to see leak. Hole will cause contrast leak. 

Leaky urine!!! What to do? Urodynamics: put catheter into pladder (Pves) and rectum (Pabd) and measure changes in pressure generated by the detrusor muscle: Pdet = Pves-Pabd. We can cause symmetrical spike in pressure via valsalva (Pdet = 0). Pdet > 0 indicates bladder contraction. 
- Involundary detrusor contractions will cause overactive bladder (hit them with botox to block involuntary detrusor contractions).
- High pressure with low flow = bladder outlet obstruction
- Rising Pves can indicate lack of bladder compliance. This can cause urinary leakage.
