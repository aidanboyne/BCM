### 1. Imaging Modalities

a. Different Imaging Modalities and Basics:
   - **Plain Film (X-ray)**: Uses ionizing radiation to create 2D images. Good for visualizing bones and dense tissues.
   - **CT (Computed Tomography)**: Combines X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images. Useful for various anatomical structures.
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate high-resolution images. Excellent for soft tissue and neurological imaging.
   - **Ultrasound**: Employs high-frequency sound waves to produce real-time images. Suitable for examining soft tissues and the cardiovascular system.
   - **Nuclear Medicine**: Involves radioactive tracers to create images of tissue function. Valuable for assessing metabolic activity.

b. **Contrast agents** (iodinated for CT, gadolinium for MRI) enhance vascular and tissue visibility, aiding in the detection of abnormalities.
- Type of contrast used for CT vs MRI:
   - **CT**: Iodinated contrast agents.
   - **MRI**: Gadolinium-based contrast agents.

c. Differences between normal PA and AP X-ray:
   - **PA (Posteroanterior)** X-ray is the standard, with the X-ray source behind the patient, minimizing radiation exposure. 
   - **AP (Anteroposterior)** X-ray involves the X-ray source in front, used in emergencies, but with increased radiation exposure. Also may magnify certain structures, especially the heart

### 2. Contraindications and Patient Safety

- **CT with Contrast**: Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
- **MRI with Contrast**: Should be avoided in patients with severe renal dysfunction or gadolinium allergies. Assess renal function before administration.

### 3. Imaging Orientations

- **Coronal**: Imaging plane divides the body into front and back sections.
- **Axial**: Images are obtained parallel to the body's long axis, dividing it into upper and lower portions.
- **Sagittal**: Images are taken perpendicular to the body's long axis, dividing it into left and right sides.

### 4. Describing Dark or Light Structures

- Radiopaque/radiolucent: CXR, CT
- Hyperdense/hypodense: CT
- Hyperintense/hypointense: MRI
- Hyperechoic/hypoechoic/anechoic: Ultrasound
- Increased/decreased uptake or "avidity": PET or SPECT (nuclear medicine)

### 5. Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Comparing Modalities**: Consider factors like cost, time, and what is visualized well/poorly. CT is fast and useful for bone imaging. MRI is excellent for soft tissue evaluation but takes more time.

### 6. Ionizing Radiation and Alternative Imaging

- **Patients to Avoid Ionizing Radiation**: Pregnant individuals and children should minimize exposure. Alternative modalities like ultrasound or MRI should be considered.

### 7. Common Clinical "Next Best Step"

- Hypotension in patient with trauma: FAST ultrasound (assess bleeding into body cavities), potentially followed by CT.
- RUQ pain: Abdominal ultrasound or CT (looking for gallstones, cholecystitis, fatty liver).
- RLQ pain: CT for suspected appendicitis (could also be Crohn's or duodenal atresia double bubble).
- Testicular/ovarian pain: Doppler ultrasound for torsion or cysts.
- Initial imaging for suspected stroke: Non-contrast CT (don't want to use contrast if hemorrhagic). For ischemic stroke, MRI.
- Asymptomatic patient with gallstones: No further imaging required.
- Female patient with lower abdominal pain: Pelvic ultrasound or transvaginal ultrasound. May also use hysterosalpingogram if we have infertility and suspected tubal occlusion.

### 8. Identifying Anatomy and Pathology

a. **Anatomy**:
   - Cross-sectional: Liver, stomach, spleen, aorta vs IVC, pancreas, small intestine, muscles, pulmonary arteries, bladder.
   - Angiography: Humeral circumflex artery, brachial artery.
   - MRI: ACL, PCL, femur, tibia, fibula.
   - Ultrasound: Endometrial stripe, bladder, myometrium, ovary.
   - Head CT: Lateral ventricles, choroid plexus, brainstem, caudate, pineal gland, vertebral body levels.

### 9. MRI Sequences on Brain Imaging

- **T1-weighted**: Demonstrates anatomy well, with fat appearing bright.
- **T2-weighted**: Highlights fluid, making it useful for detecting lesions.
- **FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery)**: Suppresses cerebrospinal fluid, enhancing lesion visibility.

### 10. Layers Pierced During Lumbar Puncture

During a lumbar puncture, you pass through the following layers sequentially:
1. Skin
2. Subcutaneous tissue
3. Supraspinous ligament
4. Interspinous ligament
5. Ligamentum flavum
6. Epidural space
7. Dura mater (arachnoid included)
8. Subarachnoid space
