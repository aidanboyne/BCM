# Hemorrhage

Acute blood loss from damaged blood vessels is known as **hemorrhage**. Internal and external hemorrhages have a variety of presentations. External bleeding is often obvious, but internal bleeding can be more difficult to ID. Hemorrhages can be classified into Class I (<15% total volume loss), Class II (15-30% loss), Class III (30-40%) and Class IV (>40%). Generally, internal hemorrhage presents with:
- Pallor and cooling of extremities
- Tachycarida
- Tachypnea
- Lightheadedness and vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency

Class III hemorrhage can present with _capillary refill >2s_, mental status change, and systolic pressures <90mmHg with narrow pulse pressure. Class IV hemorrhage often presents with absent peripheral pulses and potential **hemorrhagic shock** with characteristic lactic acidosis, multiple organ failure, coma, and death.

Significant volume depletion can result in the orthostatic hypotension and compensetory postural orthostatic tachypnea seen in the case.

### Bleed Sources


#### Intracranial Hemorrhage
- Occurs when a vessel ruptures within the brain, leading to bleeding in or around the brain.
- **Causes:**
  - Chronically elevated blood pressure weakening arterial walls.
  - Other factors: heavy alcohol use, long-term tobacco use, old age, drug abuse.
  - Trauma is a significant contributor.
- **Types:**
  - Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms or trauma.
  - Additional types: intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma.
- **Symptoms:**
  - Vary based on location: unilateral weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status.
  - SAH presents with "worst headache of life" (thunderclap headache).

#### Hemothorax
- Bleeding in pleural cavity between visceral and parietal pleura.
- **Causes:**
  - Traumatic injuries, metastatic cancer, blood clotting disorders, rarely spontaneous.
- **Symptoms:**
  - Dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain.
- **Complications:**
  - Shock or death if bleeding continues.
  - Tension hemothorax if pressure affects cardiac return, potentially fatal.

#### Abdominal Hemorrhage
- Traumatic blood loss in the abdomen requires high clinical suspicion.
- **Symptoms:**
  - Nonspecific: abdominal pain, hematemesis, hematuria, melena, bruising.
- **Severity:**
  - More severe bleeding can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death.
- **Common Sources:**
  - Organ damage, vascular injury, gynecologic/obstetric complications, coagulopathies.
  - Ectopic pregnancy and cyst rupture common in women of childbearing age.

#### Retroperitoneal Hematoma
- Retroperitoneum susceptible to injury in abdominal or pelvic trauma.
- **Zones:**
  - Zone 1: Central location, includes pancreaticoduodenal injuries, major blood vessels.
  - Zone 2: Flanks, peri-nephric regions, includes the colon.
  - Zone 3: Pelvic zone, common with pelvic fracture or femoral vascular access injuries.
- **Symptoms:**
  - Abdominal pain, back pain, flank pain, urinary symptoms, femoral nerve palsy.
- **Physical Exam Finding:**
  - Grey Turner sign (bruising on flanks).

#### Bone Fractures and Hemorrhage

Bone fractures, especially in highly vascular long bones, can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. The humerus, radius, ulna, femur, fibula, pelvis, vertebrae and particularly concerning. Usually due to traumatic injury or surgical repair.

## Hemostasis

### Primary Hemostasis [[ref]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192623310389474)

Temporary platelet plug to stop bleeding 

1. Endothelial damage causes transient vasoconstriction via neuroal stimulation reflex and endothelin release
2. vWF (from Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and alpha granules of platelets) binds exposed collagen
3. Platelets bind vWF via GpIb at site of engury, undergo conformational change and releasing ADP, calcium, and TXA2
4. ADP binds P2Y12 inducing GpIIb/IIIa expression and ensuing rapid, irreversible platelet aggregation
5. Fibrinogen generated from teh coagulation cascade binds GpIIb/IIIa receptors and links platelets.

### Blood components 

1. **Erythrocytes (RBCs)**
    - Myeloid stem cells differentiate into erythroblasts in bone marrow. These loose their nucleus and mature into reticulocytes which finally become erythrocytes in the blood
    - Lifespan of about 120 days in adults
    - Carry oxygen and CO2 via hemoglobin and HCO3
    - Production stimulated by **EPO**
2. **Thrombocytes (Platelets)**

        - Plasma cells: produce Abs. Usually reside in bone marrow and typically are not found in peripheral blood.

## Clotting Assays
- **PT/INR**: Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) assess the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, helping monitor and manage anticoagulant therapy, liver disease, and evaluate bleeding disorders. Evaluates factors **VII, X, V, II, and I** via addition of thromboplastin to plasma. **_Normal 10-13s, 1-2_**
- **PTT**: Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) evaluates the intrinsic pathway, aiding in diagnosing and managing clotting disorders such as hemophilia and monitoring heparin therapy. Evaluates factors **XII, XI, IX, VIII X V, II, and I** as well as prekallikrein and HMWK. USes silica to activate contact dependent **XII**. **_Normal 25-35s_**
- **LDH**: Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) reflects tissue damage and is elevated in conditions like hemolysis, myocardial infarction, and malignancies, serving as a nonspecific marker for cellular injury. **_Normal 140-280 U/L_**
- **D-dimer**: D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, elevated in conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), aiding in the diagnosis and exclusion of thromboembolic events. **_Normal < 500 FEU_**
- **Hemoglobin (Hgb)**: Hemoglobin measures the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, crucial in assessing anemia, polycythemia, and oxygen transport efficiency. Hemoglobin is reduced in iron deficiency, chronic disease, and sideroblastic anemias. It can also be reduced due to RBC destruction, bleeding, lead toxicity, CID, cirrhosis, and in several canceers. **_Normal Female: 12-16, Male: 14-18 g/dL_**
- **Hematocrit (Hct)**: Hematocrit represents the proportion of blood volume occupied by red blood cells, assisting in diagnosing anemia, dehydration, and evaluating erythropoietic disorders. _**Normal Female: 36-48%, Male: 41-50%**_
- **MCV**: Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) indicates the average volume of a red blood cell, aiding in classifying anemias as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. _**Normal 80-100**_
- **MCHC**: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) measures the average hemoglobin concentration in red blood cells. _**Normal 32-36 g/dL**_
- **RDW**: Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) assesses the variability in red blood cell size. _**Normal 11-15%**_
- **Reticulocytes**: Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells, and their count reflects bone marrow activity, providing insight into erythropoietic disorders and anemia etiology. _**Normal 0.5-1.5%**_
- **Platelets**: Platelets are crucial for hemostasis, and abnormalities in their count (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) can indicate bleeding or clotting disorders. _**Normal 140-400e3/mcL**_
- **RBC**: Red Blood Cell count assesses the number of circulating red blood cells, aiding in diagnosing anemias, polycythemias, and erythropoietic disorders. _**Normal Female: 3.8-5.2e6/mcL, Male: 4.0-5.9e6/mcL**_
- **WBC**: White Blood Cell count evaluates the immune response, with deviations indicating infections, inflammatory disorders, or hematologic malignancies. _**Normal 3.8-10.8e3/mcL**_

## Controlling Bleeds

Direct pressure is the primary and preferred means for controlling external hemorrhage. While clamping bleeding vessels under direct visualization is acceptable when necessary, blind clamping should not be performed. Hemorrhage due to amputation or severe extremity injury can be halted via tourniquet if pressure and hemostatic agents fail. Pelvic fractures must be stabilized via circumfrential binding, especially in open book fractures. REBOA may be necessary in massive pelvic bleeds. Methods for identifying noncompressible bleeding include focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) for the abdomen, chest radiograph for the chest, and computed tomography (CT) for the retroperitoneal space. Hemodynamically stable patients can undergo CT for further assessment. Unstable patients should be stabilized either by resuscitation in the operating room or, in some situations, with REBOA prior to going to the CT scanner.

#### Key principles

- Control compressible and extremity bleeding
- Minimize the use of intravenous (IV) fluids in the resuscitation of trauma patients. Give IV fluids only for the resuscitation of hypotensive patients (eg, MAP <65), and then only until blood is available
- Transfuse blood products as soon as the need is recognized.
- Blood products (ie, red blood cells, plasma [clotting factors], and platelets) should be given in equivalent amounts – in other words, in a 1:1:1 ratio. Whole blood can be used if available.
- Rapidly mobilize all needed resources (eg, surgery, anesthesia, blood bank, transfer to trauma center).
- Use thromboelastography, or comparable rapid point-of-care assessment of coagulation, to guide trauma resuscitation whenever possible.

#### Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

 TXA is an antifibrinolytic agent; it is a lysine analog that binds plasminogen, preventing rearrangement into its active form. It reduces all-cause and bleeding-related mortality if given within three hours of injury in patients with significant hemorrhage. The Clinical Randomization of Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial included 20,211 adult trauma patients worldwide with, or at risk of, significant bleeding [55]. Compared with placebo, TXA decreased all-cause mortality (14.5 versus 16 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97) and hemorrhage-related mortality (4.9 versus 5.7 percent, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96). Subgroup analysis found that the survival benefit of TXA was only seen in patients treated within three hours of injury.


## Aspirin

Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1) which is required to make the precursors of thromboxane within platelets. This reduces thromboxane synthesis. Thromboxane is required to facilitate platelet aggregation and to stimulate further platelet activation.

#### Baby Aspirin

A RTC with over 13,000 patients switching to 81 mg of daily aspirin found no significant differences in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between patients assigned to 81 mg and those assigned to 325 mg of aspirin daily [[ref]](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102137)

## Warfarin

Warfarin inhibits factors **II, VII, IX, X, protein C/S** via vitamin K reductase inhibition.

# Transfusion

### Blood components [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499824/)

- **Whole Blood**: Contains red blood cells and plasma, commonly used in open heart surgery and exchange transfusions for newborns with hemolytic disease.
- **Packed Red Blood Cells**: Oxygen-carrying red blood cells with most plasma removed, administered over two to four hours to replace red cells lost due to bleeding, hemolysis, or decreased bone marrow production. Generally transfused until patient reaches a hemoglobin level of 7g/dL
- **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**: Contains clotting factors, used alone or with cryoprecipitate to replace low clotting factor levels, administered over one to two hours. Rareley need in vitamin K deficiency or warfarin excess unless prothrombin complex is unavailable.
    - **Prothrombin Complex**: Different processing techniques involving ion exchangers enable the production of either three-factor (i.e., factors II, IX and X) or four-factor (i.e., factors II, VII, IX and X) concentrates with a final overall clotting factor concentration approximately 25 times higher than in normal plasma. 
- **Platelets**: Cell fragments aiding blood clotting, given over minutes to an hour, particularly for patients with bone marrow issues or platelet dysfunction. Goal platelet levels depend on risk factors.
- **Cryoprecipitate**: Contains specific clotting factors used to treat clotting defects in hemophilia or abnormal clotting conditions like DIC, administered over minutes to an hour. Fibrinogen, Factor XIII, Factor VIII, vWF, and Frbronectin.
- **Granulocytes**: Cells (neutrophils) fighting infections, administered over one to two hours to combat severe infections in patients with low granulocyte counts unresponsive to medication.

Whole blood transfusion could lead to many complications, for instance, volume overload, which is why it is advisable to use component therapy whenever possible. There are no absolute contraindications, but certain patients may refuse on religious grounds (i.e. Jehova's Witnesses).

### Tretment

1. Take a blood sample, which lasts up to 72 hours
- Send the sample to the blood bank
- Wait for the blood bank to crossmatch and prepare the needed units
- Obtain Informed Consent and Health History

2. Discuss the procedure with the patient
- Confirm the past medical history and any allergies
- The supervising provider should have obtained signed consent from the patient
- Obtain Large-bore Intravenous Access (18 gauge or larger). Each unit should be transfused within 2-4 hours. A second IV access should be secured in case the patient needs additional IV medications
    - Note: normal saline is the only fluid that can be administered with blood products. Packed red blood cells can only be given one unit at a time. Once the blood has been released for the patient, there are 20-30 minutes to begin the transfusion and up to four hours to complete it.

![Blood Typing](/img/blood_typing.png)

Patients make antibodies against any antigen they do _not_ have on their own blood cells. For example, AB+ patients make no antibodies, as they contain the A, B, and RhD antigens. Cross matching is a common lab test to verify compatibility. The test, which combines recipient serum with donor cells and watches for a reaction (i.e. agglutination), takes about an hour. [[ref]](https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/blood-basics/blood-safety-and-matching)

Universal donor blood, which is both type O and Rh negative, can be given if the recipient's blood group is not known, as may happen in an emergency. It is the policy of some institutions to reserve the releasing of O- blood only for female patients of childbearing age. This serves two purposes. First, it preserves the lower stock of O- blood and secondly, this eliminates the risk of O- negative mothers forming anti-D (Rh) antibodies from exposure to O+ blood. Anti-D (Rh) can cross the placenta during pregnancy and attack an unborn child's RBCs if they are D (Rh) positive causing haemolytic disease of the newborn.
