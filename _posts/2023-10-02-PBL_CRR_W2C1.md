# Diagnosis 

## AKI [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441896/)

AKI is defined by presence of one or more of the following
* Increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL or more (26.5 micromoles/L or more) within 48 hours
* Increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times or more baseline within the prior seven days
* Urine volume less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 hours

### Prerenal AKI

Autoregulation is impaired in CKD and in long-standing hypertension. In these conditions, a drop in systemic blood pressure can result in a fall in GFR, without any other marker of kidney damage (eg evidence of tubular injury). A profound and sustained decrease of blood pressure beyond the autoregulatory range will cause AKI [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334116/).

Reduced blood flow to the kidney. Generally tubular and glomerular function remain normal. Can be caused by:
* Hypovolemia: hemorrhage, severe burns, and gastrointestinal fluid losses such as diarrhea, vomiting, high ostomy output.
* Hypotension from the decreased cardiac output: cardiogenic shock, massive pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome
* Hypotension from systemic vasodilation: septic shock, anaphylaxis, anesthesia administration, hepatorenal syndrome
* Renal vasoconstriction: NSAIDs, iodinated contrast, amphotericin B, calcineurin inhibitors, hepatorenal syndrome
* Glomerular efferent arteriolar vasodilation: ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers

AKI improving with fluid is likley to be prerenal.

### Intrinsic Renal AKI

Conditions causing glomerular or tubular injury such as acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis. Mechanisms include:
* Acute tubular necrosis: ischemia from prolonged prerenal injury, drugs such as aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin B, pentamidine; rhabdomyolysis, intravascular hemolysis
* Acute interstitial nephritis: Drugs such as beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillins, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), 5-ASA; infections, autoimmune conditions (SLE, IgG related disease)
* Glomerulonephritis: anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, immune complex-mediated diseases such as SLE, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
* Intratubular obstruction: monoclonal gammopathy seen in multiple myeloma, tumor lysis syndrome, toxins such as ethylene glycol. 

### Postrenal AKI

Obstruction, usually due to renal/uretral calculi, tumors, clots, or other urethral blockage. This causes congestion of filtration and increases capsular hydrostatic pressure, reducing filtration. May not always present as AKI if unilateral due to contralateral compensation. 

![AKI Summary Table](/img/AKI_summary.PNG)

Typically want _blood_ (BUN, creatinine) and _urine_ (high specific gracity, low FE<sub>Na</sub>) if you suspect **prerenal**. **Renal** can be assessed with ultrasound, CT, and biopsy (especially if glomerular disease or nephritis suspected). **Postrenal** should get CT for stones, and MRI/US if tumor or prostate is suspected. Can be confirmed with bladder cath.

Ketones not very associated with AKI [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8055418/). Markers such as fractional excretion of sodium and urea and urine osmolality can help destinguish cause of AKI. However, the sensitivity of all these markers is very poor, and they are affected by many drugs very commonly used in clinical practice such as diuretics. Therefore, _no single marker can be reliably used in isolation to distinguish prerenal from renal causes of AKI_.


# Pathophysiology

### History
The providers need to look for inciting events such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, which may have caused volume loss, or any over-the-counter drugs such as NSAIDs or other nephrotoxins. Differentiating between AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is essential as CKD itself is not an uncommon risk factor for AKI. This can be achieved with the help of history in which one may find features suggestive of CKD such as chronic fatigue, anorexia, nocturia, disturbed sleep-wake cycle, polyuria, and pruritis

### Symptoms
* Too little urine leaving the body
* Swelling in legs, ankles, and around the eyes
* Fatigue or tiredness
* Shortness of breath
* Confusion
* Nausea
* Seizures or coma in severe cases
* Chest pain or pressure

#### Vitals
* Hypertension
* Tachycardia
* Reduced pulse pressure
* Tachypnea
* Hypothermia

#### Hospital AKI
* ATN – 45%
* Prerenal disease – 21%
* Acute superimposed on CKD – 13%
* Urinary tract obstruction – 10% (most often due to Benign prostatic hypertrophy in older men)
* Glomerulonephritis or vasculitis – 4%
* AIN – 2%
* Atheroemboli – 1%

#### Urine output
* Oliguria - favors AKI.
* Sudden anuria - suggests acute urinary tract obstruction, acute glomerulonephritis, or vascular catastrophe.
* Gradually diminishing urine output - may be secondary to urethral stricture or bladder outlet obstruction due to causes such as prostate enlargement.

### Differentials
* Renal calculi
* Sickle cell anemia
* Chronic renal failure
* Dehydration
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Heart failure
* Urinary tract infection
* Protein overloading
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Urinary obstruction

## Testing [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037640/)

An important limitation of all creatinine-based definitions of AKI is that they require a reference value to describe “baseline” renal function. Ideally, this value should reflect the patient’s steady-state kidney function just before the episode of AKI. However, information on pre-hospital kidney function is not always available so that various surrogate estimates are frequently used. Creatinine-based criteria for AKI often do not take into account underlying renal reserve. In patients with normal kidney function, a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl may indeed be due to an important reduction in GFR. In contrast, in patients with underlying CKD, absolute rises in serum creatinine represent variable changes in GFR, and a rise by 0.3 mg/dl may be within the acceptable daily variation and simply reflect an inconsequential change in GFR.

- Urine dipstick: glomerulonephritis (haematuria, proteinuria), acute pyelonephritis (pyuria, leucocyuria, nitrates), interstitial nephritis (maybe eosinophiluria)
- Urine sediment: tubular cells, non-dysmorphic or dysmophic red cells, red cell casts, leukocytes, white cell casts, hylaine casts, granular casts, muddy casts, crystals, and bacteria. 
- Urine electrolytes: FE<sub>Na</sub>, urea, uric acid. Not necessarily correlated with clinical findings due to confounding variables.
- Ultrasound: reduced corticomedullary differentiation and kidney size indicative of CKD. 
- Biopsy indicated if patient can tolerate and glomerular or parenchymal disease is suspected.
- CT will find stones if we suspect postrenal AKI

### AKI to CKD [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32303283)

Studies have reported that approximately 50% of hospital-associated AKI patients who had recovered successfully from AKI and were discharged were newly diagnosed with CKD during the median follow-up period of 3.3 years. Proximal tubules are the most popular cell type in the kidney, occupying almost 90% of the renal cortex, and are highly susceptible to AKI due to high ATP demand, particularly in the S3 segments in the outer medulla, and nephrotoxic insult due to concentration.

Substantial evidence has shown that injured proximal tubular cells contribute to AKI to CKD progression by promoting inflammation and fibrosis. Specific pathologic mechanisms include
- PTs can be stuck in G2/M after injury and secrete various profibrotic and proinflammatory factors 
- Mitochondrial dysfunction: prolonged ROS production and ATP deficiency
- Resident fibroblast fenotype change and proliferation to secrete more ECM.
- Activated immune response leads to monocyte and neutrophil infiltration releasing proinflammatory molecules

### Case specific manifestations

* Dry Mucus Membranes: Symptom of prior dehydration
* Swollen Abdomen/Legs (Edema): Negative finding suggests AKI not due to CHF
* Urine Amount/Frequency: AKI often leads to reduced urine output (oliguria/anuria). Also due to dehydration from diarrhea.
* Confusion (Neurological Symptoms): Uremic encephalopathy from waste buildup affecting brain function.
* Fever: Lack of fever rules out sepsis
* Positive Response to Fluids: Temporary improvement when IV fluids restore blood flow and GFR highly suggests prerenal issue.

### I&O in AKI [[ref]](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-019-2633-0)

Cumulative fluid balances (CFBs) at 24h and 72h post AKI presentation were significantly higher in the 28-day non-survivors compared with the survivors. The increase in 24h and 72h CFB was significantly associated with an increase in 7 and 28-day mortality risks. Cumulative output seems to be the more important than intake.

### Diarrhea [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6109014/)

One in ten adults hospitalized with diarrheal illness experienced AKI, with higher incidence rates in older adults. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension were associated with increased odds of AKI (all diarrhea OR 4.81, 95% CI 4.52 to 5.12 and OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.40, respectively). AKI in diarrheal illness was associated with substantial increase in mortality (OR 5.05, 95% CI 4.47 to 5.72), length of stay (mean increase 1.7 days [95% CI 1.6 to 1.8]), and cost of hospitalization (mean increase $4411 [95% CI 4023 to 4800]).

### Medication Adjustments

Indicated with:
* eGFR<45 ml/min per 1.73 m2
* Stage 2 or 3 AKI
* In adults without baseline plasma creatinine, plasma creatinine >2 mg/dl (176µmol/L) in adults or 1.5 mg/dl (132µmol/L) in the elderly or those with low muscle mass
* Plasma creatinine greater than two times the upper limit of normal for age and weight in children without a baseline plasma creatinine concentration
* The presence of oligo-anuria

Loading dose – As the Vd of many drugs, especially hydrophilic antibiotics (beta-lactams, cephalosporins, and -penems) is significantly increased in the presence of AKI, administration of aggressive loading doses (25–50% greater than normal) is highly recommended. Maintenence doses can usually be pretty much maintained. 

Aggrevating drugs (NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors/ARBs) should be discontinued immediatley. A study on the re-initiation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs following AKI [[ref]](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01659-x) found no significant differences in recurrence of AKI, but did see a slight improvement in risk of death in those who restarted medication.

# Treatment and Pharmaceuticals

## AKI Treatment

Most acute kidney injury cases recover entirely with supportive management. If the clinical scenario doesn't contradict it, all patients with acute renal dysfunction should receive a fluid challenge. They require close monitoring of urine output and renal function. If the renal function improves with fluid, that is the best indicator of a pre-Renal AKI. Acute tubular necrosis is very slow to recover and can take weeks to months for complete recovery of renal function. It may not normalize at all sometimes. Diuretics may be required during the oliguric phase of ATN if significant volume overload develops. Another important thing to consider for these patients is to avoid any further insult to the kidneys, such as nephrotoxic drugs. Any and the doses of all medications need to be renally adjusted once a patient develops AKI (see above). Another vital step is to limit the dietary ingestion of potassium and phosphorus.

If hyperkalemia develops, it needs to be managed in a robust manner because, in AKI patients, it can be catastrophic. Approaches to lower potassium in the body include:

* Dietary restriction
* Insulin, IV dextrose and beta-agonists
* potassium-binding resins
* Calcium gluconate to stabilize cardiac membrane
* Dialysis for nonresponsive hyperkalemia

Some AKI patients tend to develop volume overload, which should be corrected as early as possible to avoid pulmonary and cardiac complications. Euvolemic state can be achieved with the help of furosemide, which is a cornerstone in managing such patients. Usually, high doses of IV furosemide are needed to correct volume overload in AKI patients; however, it plays no role in converting oliguric AKI to non-oliguric AKI.

Sometimes, AKI may need short-term renal replacement therapy until the kidney function recovers. Dialysis is usually required to manage the complications of AKI, such as severe and nonresponsive hyperkalemia, uremic pericarditis, and pulmonary edema. This is seen especially in the oliguric phase of acute tubular necrosis, where the patient is prone to develop multiple electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities as well as fluid overload.

Negative prognostic factors include:

* Advanced age
* Oliguria
* Use of vasopressors
* Multiorgan dysfunction
* Need for blood transfusions
* Hypotension

Over the long term, at least 12-15% of patients with AKI may require permanent dialysis

## Ibuprofen [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4355401/)

The main mechanism of action of ibuprofen is the non-selective, reversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2 (coded for by PTGS1 and PTGS2, respectively). Additionally, Ibuprofen may activate the antinociceptive axis through binding to the cannabinoid receptors and through inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which metabolizes the endocannabinoid anandamide. CNR1 and CNR2, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2.

### Association with AKI
Inhibition of the production of vasodilatory prostanoids in the kidneys inducies vasoconstriction of afferent renal arterioles. This leads to lowered eGFR via reduced renal blood plow and subsequent fluid retention, promoting activation of the rennin–angiotensin system.

#### Dosing (pain) [[ref]](https://www.epocrates.com/online/drugs/233/ibuprofen)
Dose: 400 mg PO q4-6h prn; Max: 2400 mg/day; Info: use lowest effective dose, shortest effective tx duration; give w/ food if GI upset occurs.

Monitoring Parameters:
- Cr if severe renal dz; CBC, chemistry profile if long-term tx; BP; s/sx hepatic impairment in peds pts if dose >30 mg/kg/day or abnormal LFTs w/ prior NSAID tx

## Lisinopril [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482230/)

Lisinopril is a competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. A decrease in angiotensin II subsequently causes a reduction in aldosterone secretion, which causes a decrease in sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and decreases potassium excretion that may result in a small increase in serum potassium with lisinopril use. By removing the negative feedback of angiotensin II, lisinopril leads to increased serum renin activity.

The beneficial effects in patients with hypertension derive from the inhibitory effects in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), resulting in decreased vasopressor and aldosterone activity even in low-renin patients.

### Association with AKI

ACEIs and ARBs contribute to a fall in GFR by inhibiting vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole. However, the effect of ACEI and ARB on glomerular perfusion (by reducing hyperfiltration) can actually slow progression of chronic and diabeteic kidney disease.

It is important to note that a benign increase in serum creatinine may occur at the beginning of therapy, but medication should only be discontinued if there is a progressive or significant elevation of BUN/creatinine. 

#### Dosing (HTN) [[ref]](https://www.epocrates.com/online/drugs/1133/lisinopril)
HTN [10-40 mg PO qd]. Start: 10 mg PO qd; Max: 80 mg/day; Info: start 5 mg PO qd if on diuretic; doses >40 mg/day rarely more effective

Monitoring: CrCl <30: avoid use
- BUN/Cr at baseline, then periodically, or more frequently if heart failure, renal artery stenosis; electrolytes; BP; WBC if collagen vascular dz, especially if renal impairment


## Dialysis

### Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)
- **Process:** Peritoneal dialysis is a renal replacement therapy that involves using the peritoneal membrane in the abdomen as a natural filter. Dialysis solution (dialysate) is introduced into the peritoneal cavity via a catheter, and waste products and excess fluids pass from the bloodstream into the dialysate.
- **Indications:** PD is suitable for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who have adequate peritoneal membrane function and want more flexibility in their treatment schedule.
- **Advantages:** Continuous therapy, performed at home, fewer dietary restrictions, and lower risk of hemodynamic instability.
- **Considerations:** Risk of infection (peritonitis), daily exchange cycles, potential for glucose absorption, and gradual loss of peritoneal membrane function over time.
- **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of catheter function, dialysate characteristics, and peritoneal membrane health.

### Hemodialysis (HD)
- **Process:** Hemodialysis is an extracorporeal process that involves pumping the patient's blood through an artificial kidney (dialyzer) to remove waste products and excess fluids. The cleaned blood is then returned to the patient's body.
- **Indications:** HD is suitable for patients with ESRD and is often used in acute kidney injury (AKI) cases where rapid removal of toxins and fluid is necessary.
- **Advantages:** Efficient toxin removal, strict volume control, and suitability for critically ill patients.
- **Considerations:** Need for vascular access (arteriovenous fistula, graft, or catheter), thrice-weekly sessions in a clinic, dietary restrictions, and risk of hemodynamic instability.
- **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of vascular access patency, dialysis adequacy (urea reduction ratio, Kt/V), and management of dialysis-related complications (e.g., hypotension).
