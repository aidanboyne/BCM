## Cellular structure and function

- The **cell** is the fundamental unit of every living organism.
- **Cell membrane** (plasma membrane or plasmalemma) contains the cell contents and controls what enters and exits. It is made of a **phospholipid bilayer**.
  - **Phospholipids** have a hydrophilic "head" and a hydrophobic "tail".
  - The membrane is **semipermeable**, allowing certain molecules through using protein channels.
- The internal structure is supported by the **cytoskeleton**, made of proteins like microfilaments and microtubules.
- Inside the cell is **cytosol** and **organelles** forming the **cytoplasm**.
- The **nucleus** contains our genetic material (DNA).
  - **DNA** is tightly coiled around **histones** and forms **chromosomes**.
  - DNA is transcribed to **RNA**, which ribosomes use to produce **proteins**.
- **Ribosomes** are protein-making factories, converting mRNA to proteins through **translation**.
- **Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** is an organelle with two types:
  - **Rough ER**: with ribosomes, produces proteins.
  - **Smooth ER**: produces lipids and can detoxify chemicals or produce hormones.
- **Golgi apparatus** packages and distributes molecules in vesicles.
  - **Vesicles** can be transport, secretory, or specialized like **lysosomes**.
- **Mitochondria** are energy-generating organelles, conducting aerobic respiration to produce **ATP**.
  - Glucose undergoes **glycolysis** and then processes like the **Krebs cycle** in mitochondria.
  - Alternatively, mitochondria can burn fatty acids through **beta oxidation**.
- **Peroxisomes** modify long fatty acids for mitochondrial use, converting dangerous byproducts safely.

## Cell signaling

- Cells communicate using **chemical signals** which act on **receptors** on other cells.
  
- Signals are categorized based on distance:
  - **Autocrine signals**: Target the same cell.
  - **Paracrine signals**: Target nearby cells.
  - **Endocrine signals**: Target distant cells, examples include **hormones** and **cytokines**.
  
- **Signaling molecules** (ligands) can be:
  - **Hydrophobic**: Repel water, need **carrier proteins** to reach target cells and can cross cell membrane.
  - **Hydrophilic**: Stay in water, float freely to target cells but can't cross cell membrane.

- **Cell signaling pathway** stages:
  - **Reception**: Target cell's receptor binds to a ligand.
  - **Transduction**: The receptor activates intracellular molecules (second messengers).
  - **Response**: The cell reacts to the signal.

- **Transmembrane receptors** have three main classes:
  1. **G protein-coupled receptors**: Long proteins that activate intracellular **G proteins** (subunits: alpha, beta, gamma). G proteins use **GDP** (inactive) or **GTP** (active) and have types: **Gq, Gi, Gs**.
     - **Gq**: Activates **phospholipase C** which cleaves phospholipids, leading to calcium release and activation of **protein kinase C**.
     - **Gs**: Stimulates **adenylate cyclase** converting **ATP** to **cAMP**, which binds and activates **protein kinase A**.
     - **Gi**: Inhibits adenylate cyclase for negative feedback.
     
  2. **Enzyme-coupled receptors**: Single-pass transmembrane proteins with intrinsic enzyme activity.
     - **Receptor tyrosine kinases**: Most common, cross-phosphorylate upon ligand binding.
     - **Tyrosine kinase associated receptors**: Similar to above but without intrinsic enzyme activity.
     - **Receptor serine/threonine kinases**: Two classes (type I and II) that phosphorylate target proteins.
     
  3. **Ion channel receptors**: Open when a ligand binds, allowing ions to flow and change the cell's electric charge.

## Pharmacology Essentials

- **Pharmacology** is the study of how drugs or chemicals interact with living systems to produce effects.
  
- **Drug Development**:
  1. **Discovery**: Identification of a potential therapeutic compound.
  2. **Preclinical Research**: Testing on cell cultures and animals for safety.
  3. **Clinical Development**: Human trials in 4 phases:
     - **Phase I**: **Safety** assessment in a small group of healthy individuals.
     - **Phase II**: **Efficacy** determination in a moderately sized group with the condition.
     - **Phase III**: Comparison to standard treatments for **Approval** by regulatory bodies.
     - **Phase IV**: Monitoring for **Long term** or rare side effects post-market.
  
- **Drug Naming**:
  - **Chemical Name**: Describes its chemical structure.
  - **Generic Name**: Shortened version used by health professionals.
  - **Brand/Trade Name**: Given by pharmaceutical companies.

- **Pharmacokinetics (PK)**: What the body does to the drug, represented by **ADME**:
  - **Absorption**: Entry into the circulation.
  - **Distribution**: Movement to body tissues.
  - **Metabolism**: Chemical modification/breakdown.
  - **Excretion**: Removal from the body.

- **Pharmacodynamics (PD)**: What the drug does to the body.
  - Drugs bind to **receptors** triggering cellular changes.
  - Effects can be **therapeutic** (desired) or lead to **side effects** (unwanted).

- **Therapeutic Index (TI)**:
  - Ratio of toxic dose to effective dose.
  - A higher TI indicates a safer drug.
  - Medications with a low TI have a narrow safety margin and need close monitoring (e.g., warfarin, lithium).

- **Drug Interactions**:
  - **Pharmacokinetic Interactions**: One drug alters the ADME of another.
  - **Pharmacodynamic Interactions**: Drugs directly influence each other's effects, can be **synergistic** (combined effect greater than the sum of individual effects) or **antagonistic** (one drug opposes the effect of another).

## Drug administration and dosing

- **Routes of Administration**:
  1. **Enteral**: Medication is administered through the gastrointestinal tract.
     - **Peroral (Oral)**: Swallowed.
     - **Sublingual**: Placed under the tongue.
     - **Buccal**: Between the gums and inner cheek.
     - **Rectal**: Into the rectum.
  2. **Parenteral**: Bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.
     - **Intravenous (IV)**: Into a vein.
     - **Subcutaneous (SC)**: Under the skin.
     - **Intramuscular (IM)**: Into muscle.
  3. **Topical**: Applied on the skin or mucous membranes for local or systemic effect.

- **Factors influencing route choice**:
  - **Medication properties**: Stability, absorption capability.
  - **First-pass effect**: Medications extensively metabolized before reaching systemic circulation when administered orally.
  - **Bioavailability**: Portion of non-IV administered medication reaching systemic circulation. E.g., 60% bioavailability means 60% of the oral dose reaches circulation.

- **Dosing Regimens**:
  1. **Single Dosing**: One-time administration.
  2. **Continuous Infusion**: Constant rate IV administration.
     - **Steady State**: Dosing rate = Elimination rate.
     - Achieved in about 4-5 half-lives of the drug.
  3. **Intermittent Dosing**: Regular intervals of administration.
     - Fluctuating plasma concentration between peaks and troughs.
     - Steady state after 4 or 5 half-lives.

- **Dose Calculations**:
  - **Maintenance Dose**: Dose needed to maintain steady state.
    - Depends on clearance rate, bioavailability, and dosing interval.
  - **Loading Dose**: Initial large dose to rapidly reach desired plasma concentration.
    - Depends on volume of distribution (Vd) and bioavailability.

- **Volume of Distribution (Vd)**:
  - Indicates how widely a drug distributes in the body.
  - Small Vd: Remains in plasma. Large Vd: Widely distributed in the body.

- **Considerations for dosing**:
  - Individuals with decreased clearance (e.g., due to liver or renal disease) may need lower maintenance doses or extended dosing intervals.
  - Initial loading dose typically remains the same since Vd is not affected.

The route of administration is chosen based on medication properties and the clinical situation. Dosing regimens dictate how frequently and in what quantity a medication is given, with maintenance and loading doses determined by various pharmacokinetic parameters, ensuring both efficacy and safety.


## Histology

**Histology and its Importance:**
- Histology studies tissues and organs using microscopy.
- Integrating histology with other disciplines enhances our understanding of body functions.
- Structures of human tissues align with their functions.

**Microscopy:**
- Various types include light microscopy (LM), scanning probe, ultraviolet, virtual, and electron microscopy.
- LM, especially bright field microscopy, is commonly used due to its practicality.

### Tissue Preparation for Bright Field Microscopy:
1. **Fixation**: Preserves tissue using formalin.
2. **Processing**: Removes water from tissue using ethanol and xylene.
3. **Embedding**: Tissue is embedded in paraffin wax forming a "paraffin block".
4. **Sectioning**: A microtome is used to cut thin slices from the paraffin block.
5. **Staining**: Commonly used stain is hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

### Staining:
- **Hematoxylin**: A basic dye staining negatively charged structures (basophilic) purple or dark blue (e.g., nuclei, ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum).
- **Eosin**: An acidic dye staining positively charged (eosinophilic) structures red or pink (e.g., collagen, cytoplasmic proteins, mitochondria).
- Other stains:
  - **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)**: Stains complex carbohydrates dark red or magenta.
  - **Masson trichrome**: Highlights connective tissue, particularly collagen.
  - **Alcian blue**: Stains acidic polysaccharides blue.
  - **Van Gieson**: Used for blood vessels and skin.
  - **Giemsa**: Used for blood and bone marrow smears.
  - **Sudan black and osmium**: Stains lipid-containing structures brown or black.

**Frozen Sections:**
- Used for fast results, especially in surgeries.
- Tissues are embedded in OCT compound and quickly frozen.
- Sectioned in a cryostat, a subfreezing temperature microtome.
- Stains used include H&E, methylene blue, and/or PAS.
- Not as high quality as permanent sections but offer rapid turn-around.

**Permanent Sections vs. Frozen Sections:**
- Permanent sections provide better image quality and are made from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue.
- Preparation can take from 12 hours to 2.5 days.
- Frozen sections are quicker but of lesser quality, used for urgent analysis.

## Breast Cancer
- Breast cancer is the uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells within the breast.
- It's the second most common cancer in women and can occasionally affect men.
- It's also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, mainly because symptoms may not appear until advanced stages.

### Anatomy and Physiology:
- The breast is primarily made up of lobules (milk-producing glands), ducts (that transport milk), and stroma (fatty tissue).
- Glandular tissue has hormone receptors, particularly estrogen and progesterone, which stimulate alveolar cells to divide.

### Risk Factors:
- Factors increasing risk include early onset of menstruation, late menopause, estrogen-based medications, and ionizing radiation.
- Factors decreasing risk are early pregnancy and prolonged breastfeeding.
- Mutations in BRCA-1, BRCA-2, and TP53 genes increase risk.
- HER-2 gene mutations promote cell growth and are associated with certain breast cancers.

### Cancer Development:
- Typically arises from epithelial cells lining the ducts or lobules.
- Initial growth is within the basement membrane called in-situ carcinoma (either ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS)).
- Over time, DCIS can become invasive, whereas LCIS typically does not.

**Breast Cancer Classification:**
- Classified based on hormone receptor presence: ER-positive/HER2-negative, HER2-positive/ER-positive or negative, and ER-negative/HER2-negative.

**Symptoms and Signs:**
- Initial symptom often a hard, painless lump.
- Additional signs include underarm swelling, breast immobility, skin dimpling, nipple retraction, and symptoms of Paget's disease (itchiness, redness, nipple discharge).

**Diagnosis:**
- Mammography is key for screening and early detection.
- Ultrasound, MRI, and biopsy may be used for diagnosis.
- Staging uses the TNM system (Tumor size, Node involvement, Metastasis presence).

### Treatment:
- Varies depending on type and stage.
- Includes surgery (partial or total mastectomy), radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.

## Pharmacodynamics

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Studies the mechanisms and effects of medications within the body. It essentially examines what medications do to the body and how they achieve their effects.

- **Receptors**: Specialized proteins on or inside cells that bind to ligands.
  - Ligands can be **agonists**, which activate the receptor, leading to a cascade of signals within the cell, resulting in some form of cellular response.

- **Desensitization and Tolerance**: 
  - Continuous exposure to the same agonist can lead to a decreased cellular response. 
  - **Desensitization** (or **Tachyphylaxis**): Rapid decrease in receptor response upon repeated exposure to an agonist.
  - **Tolerance**: Gradual decrease in receptor response over time with repeated exposure to an agonist.

- **Mechanisms of Desensitization and Tolerance**:
  1. **Downregulation**: Reduced synthesis of new receptors.
  2. **Sequestration/Internalization**: Increased endocytosis and degradation of existing receptors.
  3. **Receptor Uncoupling**: Receptors are modified so they can't activate secondary messenger proteins.
  4. **Exhaustion of Intermediate Messengers**: Depletion of necessary intermediate molecules; for example, depletion of amines in response to amphetamine.
  5. **Increased Metabolic Breakdown**: Enhanced production of enzymes that metabolize the drug, like in chronic alcohol use.
  6. **Decreased Metabolism**: Tolerance due to decreased breakdown, as seen with nitrovasodilators.
  7. **Physiological Adaptation**: Body adapts to counteract the effects of the drug, as seen with diuretics and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Agonists and Antagonists

  - **Agonists**: Medications that activate receptors. 
    - **Full Agonists**: Can produce the maximal possible response for a receptor when bound.
    - **Partial Agonists**: Produce a response that is less than the maximal response, even when all receptors are occupied.

  - **Antagonists**: Medications that prevent receptor activation.
    - **Competitive Antagonists**: Reversibly bind to the same receptor site as an agonist but do not activate it. Their effects can be overcome by increasing the amount of agonist.
    - **Non-Competitive Antagonists**: Bind to a different part of the receptor (allosteric site) or bind irreversibly, preventing activation by agonists. Their effects cannot be overcome by increasing the amount of agonist.

- **Graphical Representation**:
  - The dose-response curve shows the relationship between drug dose and its effect.
  - **Emax**: The maximal effect a drug can produce.
  - **ED50**: The dose of a drug required to produce 50% of its maximal effect.
  - **Potency**: The dose of a drug required to produce a maximal response.
  - **Efficacy**: The maximal effect that a drug can produce.

![Dose response curve](/img/DoseCurve.jpg)

- **Effect of Competitive Antagonists**: They shift the dose-response curve to the right, increasing ED50 (decreasing potency) but not affecting Emax (efficacy remains the same).
- **Effect of Non-Competitive Antagonists**: They reduce Emax (decreasing efficacy) but do not affect the position or shape of the curve (potency remains the same).

## Enzymes

**Enzymes and their Role:**
- Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts, speeding up biochemical reactions.
- They help transform substrates into products, reducing the activation energy required.
- Without enzymes, many reactions would be too slow to support life.

**Reaction Coordinate Diagram:**
- Shows the progression of a biochemical reaction.
- **ΔG**: Gibbs free energy; difference in energy between substrate and product.
- **ΔG‡++**: Activation energy; energy barrier a substrate needs to overcome to reach the transition state.

![Reaction Coordinate](/img/Rxn.png)

**Enzyme Action:**
- Enzymes have an active site where substrates bind, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.
- Enzymes stabilize the transition state, reducing the activation energy and speeding up the reaction.
- Each enzyme is specific to its substrate.

**Enzyme Kinetics:**
- **Michaelis Menten Graph**: Plots substrate concentration ([S]) against reaction velocity (V).
  - **Vmax**: Maximum reaction speed when all enzyme sites are saturated.
  - **Km**: Substrate concentration at half of Vmax. Inversely reflects enzyme affinity.

![MM Plot](/img/mmcurve.jpg)

- **Lineweaver-Burke Plot**: A double reciprocal plot of the Michaelis Menten equation.
  - Y-intercept = 1/Vmax
  - X-intercept = -1/Km

![LB Plot](/img/lineweaver.jpg)

**Factors Affecting Enzyme Action:**
- **Agonists and Antagonists**: Substances that can increase or decrease enzyme activity, respectively.
  - **Induction**: Increases gene expression, leading to increased enzyme production.
  - **Repression**: Decreases gene expression, leading to decreased enzyme production.
  - **Up-regulation**: Increases the number of receptors or transporters on a cell's surface.
  - **Down-regulation**: Decreases the number of receptors or transporters on a cell's surface.
- **Competitive Inhibition**: When a molecule binds to an enzyme's active site, blocking the substrate.
- **Non-Competitive Inhibition**: When a molecule binds to an allosteric site, changing the enzyme's shape and preventing substrate binding.

**Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation**: 
- Change an enzyme's shape and affect its activity.
- Kinases add phosphate groups (phosphorylation) while phosphatases remove them (dephosphorylation).
