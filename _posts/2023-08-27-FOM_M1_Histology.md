## Histology

**Histology and its Importance:**
- Histology studies tissues and organs using microscopy.
- Integrating histology with other disciplines enhances our understanding of body functions.
- Structures of human tissues align with their functions.

**Microscopy:**
- Various types include light microscopy (LM), scanning probe, ultraviolet, virtual, and electron microscopy.
- LM, especially bright field microscopy, is commonly used due to its practicality.

### Tissue Preparation for Bright Field Microscopy:
1. **Fixation**: Preserves tissue using formalin.
2. **Processing**: Removes water from tissue using ethanol and xylene.
3. **Embedding**: Tissue is embedded in paraffin wax forming a "paraffin block".
4. **Sectioning**: A microtome is used to cut thin slices from the paraffin block.
5. **Staining**: Commonly used stain is hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

### Staining:
- **Hematoxylin**: A basic dye staining negatively charged structures (basophilic) purple or dark blue (e.g., nuclei, ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum).
- **Eosin**: An acidic dye staining positively charged (eosinophilic) structures red or pink (e.g., collagen, cytoplasmic proteins, mitochondria).
- Other stains:
  - **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)**: Stains complex carbohydrates dark red or magenta.
  - **Masson trichrome**: Highlights connective tissue, particularly collagen.
  - **Alcian blue**: Stains acidic polysaccharides blue.
  - **Van Gieson**: Used for blood vessels and skin.
  - **Giemsa**: Used for blood and bone marrow smears.
  - **Sudan black and osmium**: Stains lipid-containing structures brown or black.

**Frozen Sections:**
- Used for fast results, especially in surgeries.
- Tissues are embedded in OCT compound and quickly frozen.
- Sectioned in a cryostat, a subfreezing temperature microtome.
- Stains used include H&E, methylene blue, and/or PAS.
- Not as high quality as permanent sections but offer rapid turn-around.

**Permanent Sections vs. Frozen Sections:**
- Permanent sections provide better image quality and are made from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue.
- Preparation can take from 12 hours to 2.5 days.
- Frozen sections are quicker but of lesser quality, used for urgent analysis.

## Breast Cancer
- Breast cancer is the uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells within the breast.
- It's the second most common cancer in women and can occasionally affect men.
- It's also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, mainly because symptoms may not appear until advanced stages.

### Anatomy and Physiology:
- The breast is primarily made up of lobules (milk-producing glands), ducts (that transport milk), and stroma (fatty tissue).
- Glandular tissue has hormone receptors, particularly estrogen and progesterone, which stimulate alveolar cells to divide.

### Risk Factors:
- Factors increasing risk include early onset of menstruation, late menopause, estrogen-based medications, and ionizing radiation.
- Factors decreasing risk are early pregnancy and prolonged breastfeeding.
- Mutations in BRCA-1, BRCA-2, and TP53 genes increase risk.
- HER-2 gene mutations promote cell growth and are associated with certain breast cancers.

### Cancer Development:
- Typically arises from epithelial cells lining the ducts or lobules.
- Initial growth is within the basement membrane called in-situ carcinoma (either ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS)).
- Over time, DCIS can become invasive, whereas LCIS typically does not.

**Breast Cancer Classification:**
- Classified based on hormone receptor presence: ER-positive/HER2-negative, HER2-positive/ER-positive or negative, and ER-negative/HER2-negative.

**Symptoms and Signs:**
- Initial symptom often a hard, painless lump.
- Additional signs include underarm swelling, breast immobility, skin dimpling, nipple retraction, and symptoms of Paget's disease (itchiness, redness, nipple discharge).

**Diagnosis:**
- Mammography is key for screening and early detection.
- Ultrasound, MRI, and biopsy may be used for diagnosis.
- Staging uses the TNM system (Tumor size, Node involvement, Metastasis presence).

### Treatment:
- Varies depending on type and stage.
- Includes surgery (partial or total mastectomy), radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.
