# Lecture Notes

## Kidney anatomy

Kindeys excrete and remove metabolic waste and foreign substance via urine. Also activate vitamin D and help maintain fluid vol., pH, BP, and electrolytes. Secrete EPO.

Adrenal glands sit on top, ureters lead out to bladder. Posterior to peritoneum (retroparitoneal) and lie on posterior abominal wall. Both around T12-L3 and R. kidney lower to accomodate liver.

* Anterior to L. Kidney: spleen, pancreas, stomach, L-cloic flexure, and jejunum.
* Anterior to R. Kidney: liver, duodemum, R-colic  flexure and asc. colon. Separated from liver by hepatorenal recess (Morrisons pouch).

Renal hilum on concave medial margin contains renal vessels, nerves, and ureters. Renal veins lie anterior to renal aa. Renal pelvis is most posterior and is superior portion of ureter. The kidneys are surrounded by connective tissue (renal fascia), distal paranephric, and proximal perinephric fat. The kidney is directly enveloped by the renal capsule. 

### Internal structure
Outer renal cortex, inner renal medualla.

Columns extend into medulla dividing it into renal pyramids whose apex (renal papilla) directed towards hilumn where urine is excreted into minor calyx --> major calyx --> renal pelvis. 

Renal arteries are direct branches of abdominal aorta at L1-L2. R. renal a. is longer as abdominal aorta is L of vertebral column. Vertebral veins drain into IVC. L. renal vein drains L. inferior phrenic, L. suprarenal, and L. gonadal vv. It passes anterior to abdominal aorta and posterior to superior mesenteric a.


### Ureters

Renal pelvis meets ureters at ureteropelvic junction and descend anterior to psoas major until socroilliac joints and cross into the pelvic inlet anterior to common iliac a. before emptying into bladder. Constriction points (high probability of kidney stone obstruction) include:
1. Ureteropelvic junction
2. Brim of pelvic inlet
3. Vesicourteric junction

These are supplied proximally from renal aa., in the middle by branches of aorta, gonadal, and common iliac aa., and distally by branches of superior and inferior vesical aa. The ascending and descending limbs form longitudinal anastimoses. They are drained by renal, gonadal, and vesicular vv. cranially to caudually. 

### Suprarenal (Adrenal) Glands
Secrete steroid (cortisol, aldosterone...) and catecholamine (epinephrine, norepi) hormones. Steriods regulate stress and fluid balance. R. is shaped like pyramid and L. is semilunar. R. is associated with IVC, R. lobe of liver, and posteriorly the R. crus of diaphragm, while L. is associated with stomach, pancreas, spleen, and posteriorly the L. crus of diaphragm.

Cotex produces steriods and medulla produces catecholamines. They are supplied by the superior/middle/inferior suprarenal aa. which arise from inf. phrenic, aorta, and renal aa. respectivly. They are drained via R. suprarenal v. (to IVC) and L. suprarenal v. (to L. renal v.).

### Lymphatics
- _Lateral aortic lymph nodes_
  - Suprarenal
  - Kidneys
  - Upper ureter 
- _Common, external, and internal illiac lymph nodes_
  - Lower ureters

### Innervation

Renal plexus innervates kidney via sympathetic (thoracolumbar splanchnic n.) and parasympathetic (vagal trunk). Abdominal urters via ureteric plexus (supplied by renal, aortic, and hypogastric). Adrenal glands via celiac plexus and thoracolumbar splanchinic n.

## Renal Development

Starts at week 4 from the **intermediate mesoderm** which condenses into the **urogenital ridge** whigh runs parallel to vertebral column. The **nephrogenic cord** is part of ridge and develops into urogenical structures. Structures form cranially to caudually:
1. **Pronephros** (W4): pronephric duct and nephrotomes. Pronephros regresses by end of W4
2. **Mesonephros**: mesonephric duct and tubules develop off pronephric duct and extend to cloaca. The tubules are hollow and s shaped and form bowman's capsule around glomerulus. Urine drains through mesonephric duct into cloaca until about week 10. Totally regress around W12.
    - Persists partially as Wolffian duct in males (ductus deferens and epididymis).
3. **Metanephros** (W5): forms in pelvic region and eveuntually will be permanent kidneys. Mesoderm nearby becomes metanephric mesoderm which produces growth factors inducing ureteric bud and stalk. This then recipricoally inducts the metanephric mesoderm and grows into it.
    - The ureteric stalk lengthens into ureter in W6.
    - Ureteric bud in the metanephric mesoderm divides into renal plexus in W7-8 and condinues dividing into major, minor calyx and finally into collecting tubules. This begins nephron formation in W8
    - Permanant system takes over all urine produciton around W10

Nephrons form around metanephric tissue caps (**metanephric blastema**) starting with metanephric vesicles which elongate into s-shaped tube. The part that connects with metanephric vesicle is DCT and other end is PCT which cups around capillary from branch of aorta (bowmann's and glomerulus). The middle elongates and becomes loop of henle, becoming permanant kidney and taking over from mesonephros in W10. Nephrogenesis is usuall complete by W36

Kidneys ascend and change aterial supply from common iliac aa. to new branch of aorta: the renal aa.

### Urinary development

- Urorectal septum splits cloacal into posterior anal canal and anterior urogenital sinus in W4. 
  - Top of urogenital sinus forms primitive bladder and is connected at first by mesonephric duct which is slowly absorbed as vesical trigone into bladder in W5-6. 
  - Middle portion forms urethra in females and prostatic/membranous urethra in males. 
  - The end forms clitoris in females and penis in males. 

## Congential Renal Disorders

Babies who cannot "pee" in utero develop **Potter Sequence**;
 - **P**ulmonary Hypoplasia
 - **O**ligohydramnios (amniotic fluid primarily formed from fetal urine - triggers all of other abnormalities)
 - **T**wisted face
 - **T**wisted skin
 - **E**xtremity defects
 - **R**enal failure (in utero)

Less space in utero is main cause of extremity defects.

**Ureteric bud** forms the ureter, renal pelvis, renal calyces, and collecting ducts
**Metanephric blastema** forms the nephrons

### Cystic Disorders
- Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease **(ARPKD)**
  - **PKHD1** gene mutation causes lack of **fibrocystin**
  - Cystic dilation of collecting ducts b/l
  - May develop POTTER sequence in utero. Otherwise get progressive renal failure and systemic hypertension
  - Also causes congential hepatic fibrosis --> portal hypertension
- Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease **(ADPKD)**
  - More common and symptoms develop in adulthood
  - **PKD1** or **PKD2** mutation leading to lack of polycystin 1 or 2 (cell growth/proliferation inhibitors)
  - Presence of one functional gene allows OK function, but second hit will cause disruption of renal cell growth and fluid-filled cyst formation which causes tissue damage, hypertension, and flank pain.
    - HTN and proteinuria indicates treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARDs
  - Also leads to liver failure due to liver cysts and higher rates of:
    - Berry aneurysm (aneurysm in circle of willis - rupture = subarachnoid hemorrhage)
    - Mitral valve prolapse
    - Diverticulosis
  - Presents with flank _pain, hematuria, hypertension, and family Hx of sudden death with aneurysm_
- **Medullary sponge kidey**
  - Present at birth due to abnormal induction of metanephric blastemia causing cystic tubules in nephrons (esp. collecting ducts, causing meduallary dilaton)
  - Usually discovered in adulthood. Presents with urinary stasis and possible hypercalciuria
- **Multicystic dysplastic kidney**
  - Non-inhereted
  - Ureteric buds fail to cause differentiation of metanephric blastema --> no ureters, renal calyces, collecting ducts, and tubules.
  - **Often unilateral** and asymptomatic. Bilateral leads to POTTER's sequence
- **Autosomal dominant tubulointerstital kidney disease** (meduallry cystic disease)
  - Mucin or uromodulin gene mutation --> tubulointerstital fibrosis and potential cysts --> renal insuficiency and dilute urine --> renal failure
  - Presents as gout at young age, small kidneys on US without meduallry cysts

### Noncystic Disorders

- **Renal Agenesis**: ureteric bud fails to induce development of metanephric blastema
  - Likely genetic and environmental (toxin and infection)
  - B/l causes POTTER's and incompatible with life
  - Unilateral is often asymptomatic as functioning kidney hypertrophies. Can progress to renal failure
- **Duplex collecting system**
  - Bifid renal pelvis
  - Partial ureteral duplication (_y-shaped ureter_)
  - Incomplete ureteral duplication (_v-shaped ureter_)
  - Complete uretrhal duplication (_separate ureteric openings_)
  - Associated with other abnormalities i.e. ureterocele (obstructs urine --> vesicoureteral refux and frequent UTI)
- Posterior urethral valves **(PUV)**
  - Congenital disorder in males
  - Abnormal fusion of mesonephric duct with cloaca leadin to membranous folds at posterior urethra --> bladder outlet obstruction
    - Most common bladder outlet obstruction in males
    - Dx via ultrasound with bilated bladder, thickened ballader walls, b/l hydronephrosis
- **Horseshoe kidney**
  - Fusion of kidneys in developent in W4-6 via fibrous isthmus
  - Associated with aneuploidy (turner, trisomy 13, 18, 21) and teratogens (thalidomide and alcohol)
  - W7-8 fused kidneys trapped under inf. mesenteric a. keeping them lower
  - Normal function at first but can have urinary stasis or ureteropelvic junction causing increased UTI, kindey stone, and hydronephrosis
