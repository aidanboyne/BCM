## Bone formation and Remodeling

Bone forms via two processes:
1. **Endochondral Ossification**: Mesenchymal tissue first differentiates into chonrdorcytes which form a collagenous matrix. A primary ossification center and accompanying vasculature form in the center of the maxtrix and expand towards each end. Secondary ossifcation centers at the end of the matrix form soon afterwards, separated from the primary ossification center by the physis, or growth plate. Endochondral ossification occurs in long bones and in non-rigid bone healing.
2. **Intramembranous Ossification**: Mesenchymal tissue differentiates directly into osteocytes which form preliminary osteoid tissue which is then calcified into mature bone. This occurs in flat bones and in the healing of bones under rigid-fixation.

#### Osteoclasts, Osteoblasts, and Osteocytes

![Rank](/img/Bone_remodeling.PNG)

Bone remodeling is a balance of breakdown, replacement, and calcification. The primary regulators of this process are the osteoblasts which produce several proteins such as M-CSF (increasing osteoclast precursors), RANKL (inducing osteoclast differentiation and activity), and OPG (blocking RANKL-RANK interaction and halting osteoclastic activity). Osteoblasts are in turn regulated by PTH, calcitriol, 1,25D, IL-1, PGE2 to increase RANKL expression.

Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRRP5) is also hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining bone strength, as patients with low or absent LRRP5 often develop osteoperosis. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45504/)

#### Estrogen [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424385/)

Estrogen has been shown to inhibit osteoblast apoptosis and increase osteoblast lifespan, thereby increasing the functional capacity of each osteoblast. At a molecular level, the effects of estrogen on reducing osteoblast apoptosis are due to activation of the Src/Shc/ERK signaling pathway and downregulation of JNK, which alters the activity of a number of transcription factors.

During bone growth estrogen is needed for proper closure of epiphyseal growth plates both in females and in males. Also in young skeleton estrogen deficiency leads to increased osteoclast formation and enhanced bone resorption. In menopause estrogen deficiency induces cancellous as well as cortical bone loss.  At cellular level in bone estrogen inhibits differentiation of osteoclasts thus decreasing their number and reducing the amount of active remodeling units. This effect is probably mediated through some cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6 being strongest candidates. Estrogen regulates the expression of IL-6 in bone marrow cells by a so far unknown mechanism.

#### Excersice

Strains which are high in rate and magnitude, and of abnormal distribution, but not necessarily long in duration, are best for inducing new bone formation, resulting in the strengthening of bone by increased density. Cross-sectional studies show that athletes, especially those who are strength-trained, have greater bone mineral densities than nonathletes, and that strength, muscle mass and maximal oxygen uptake correlate with bone density. Longitudinal training studies indicate that strength training and high impact endurance training increase bone density. Strain induction, the deformation that occurs in bone under loading, may cause a greater level of formation and an inhibition of resorption within the normal remodelling cycle of bone, or it may cause direct activation of osteoblastic bone formation from the quiescent state. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the transformation of mechanical strain into biochemical stimuli to enhance bone formation. These include prostaglandin release, piezoelectric and streaming potentials, increased bone blood flow, microdamage and hormonally mediated mechanisms. These mechanisms may act on their own or in concert, depending on the loading situation and the characteristics of the bone.

### Calcium Regulation [[ref]](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/45/8/1347/5643331)

Plasma calcium is tightly controlled by flux between the kidney, bone, and gut. The flow of calcium is regulated by **PTH**, **calcitonin**, and **1,25(OH)D3** (Vitamin D). The typical adult ingests around 1g of calcium per day, 85% of which is excreted by the GI tract and 150mg of which is excreted by the kidney. Plasma calcium is exchanged with soft tissue, bone (about 500mg both ways per day), the gut, and the kidney. Plasma calcium exists in serum as ions (45%), bound to albumin (40%) and bound to anions. Hydrogen and calcium compete for albumin binding sites, so acidic conditions lead to higher ionized serum calcium and thus decreased PTH. The opposite occurs under basic conditions.

The skeleton contains the majority of calcium stores (1-1.3kg) which is almost all in the form of hydroxyapetite. PTH is always released a base level which increases with low serum calcium and stimulates:
1. Osteoclastic activity and release of calciuma and phosphate from bone
2. Increased calcium reabsorbtion and phosphate excretion from renal tubueles
3. Increased renal production of active vitamin D

1,25(OH)D3 inturn increases the absorbtion of calcium (and phosphate) from the GI tract via binding of intracellular vitamin D receptors. Excessive calcium triggers secretion of calcitonin by C-cells of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin then downregulates the activity of osteoclasts and is thought to facilitate the deposition of calcium and phosphate in the bone, especailly in the post-prandial state. It also increases production of active vitamin D, though via a different pathway than PTH. It is not as important as PTH and one can survive without it.

## Osteoperosis [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201669)

Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder that is characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. Fractures of the proximal femur, the vertebrae and the distal radius are the most frequent osteoporotic fractures, although most fractures in the elderly are probably at least partly related to bone fragility. The incidence of fractures varies greatly by country, but on average up to 50% of women >50 years of age are at risk of fractures. The most common type of osteoporosis is postmenopausal, resulting from estrogen deficiency. A working group of the WHO has defined osteoporosis operationally as a BMD that is 2.5 standard deviations below the peak bone mass for adult women, or lower.

Variants in the genes encoding factors known to regulate bone mass (such as estrogen receptor-α (ERα)22, vitamin D receptor23, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)24, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6 (both involved in WNT signalling))25 and bone matrix components (for example, collagen type I α1 (Ref. 26)) were found to be associated with bone mass and fracture risk, but these variants could be used to explain only very little of the inter-individual variation. 

Traebeculated bone generally is lost earlier and more rapidly than cortical bone, especially following menopause, explaining the greater incidence of vertebral fractures over forearm or femur/hip fractures in osteoperosis.

Postmenopausal women over the age of 50 should be assessed via daul energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

Prevention should be acheived via increasing maximum bone mass in childhood and adolecence and minimizing loss post-menopause and supplementation of calcium and vitamin D if patients have levels below normal. Smoking should be stopped.


#### DEXA Scans

Quantifies bone mineral content by using two energy x-rays to allow for subtraction of soft tissue attenuation to determine attenuation caused soley by bone mineral. Modifiable causes of low BMD such as certain drugs (glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors,PPIs, glitazones, anti-epeliptics/depressants), renal osteodystrophy, anorexia, Cushing, vitamin D deficiency, hyperthyroid/parathyroidism, malabsorbition, hematological malignancy, and inhereted bone malformations must be ruled out.

### Bisphosphonates

Potent bisphosphonates include alendronate, risendronate, and zoledronate. These are approved for use in reducing fracture risk in osteoperotic patients. They bind bone mineral and are ingested by osteoclasts, supressing their activity via inhibiton of mevalonate pathway enzymes. Oral bisphosphonates often (20%) cause GI issues and IV infusion can cause transient flu-like symptoms and acute renal failure in patients with low GFR (<35ml/min). Other side effects include jaw osteonecrosis, atypicl femoral fractures (lateal cortex of shaft).

### Calcium

- **Calcium supplements**: Calcium supplementation in adults has not been shown to have any impact on frature prevention. Excess supplementation may increase risk of myocardial infarction and nephrolithiasis. 
- **Vitamin D**: adequate vitamin D is required to prevent high PTH which increases fracture risk. Supplementaiton of > 800IU qDay have been shown to help prevent hip fractures, especialyl when combined with calcium. However, it does result in reduced muscle strength. Viatmin D supplementation alone is very effective at reducing osteomalacia.

### Other treatments
- **Denosumab** is a RANKL antibody administered sub-Q resulting in reduced turnover of bone.
- **Teriparatide** is a polypeptide (the N-terminal 34 AAs of PTH) causing increased deposition, especially in the vertebrae with minimal side effects other than nausea, headache, and hypercalcemia.
- **Strontium**: ion replacing calcium in bone reducing reabsorbtion. High risk of MI.
- **Estorgen Replacement** has a mixed bag of effects, decreasing fractures (very effectivley) and colon cancer but increasing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic events.
- **SERMs** (selective estrogen receptor modulators) reduce fracture risk, mainly in the vertebrae. Some increased risk of thromboembolic disease.

## Osteomalacia

Vitamin D deficiency (most common deficiency) causes abnormal osteoid mineralization. In children, this causes rickets, while it causes osteomalacia in adults. Prevalence increases in cold climates with less sun, nutritional/malabsorbtive deficits, CKD or liver disease, hypophosphatemic or hypocalcemia patients. Certain drugs such as antiepileptics, isoniazid, rifambin, and antifungals can also result in vitamin D deficiency.

Symptoms include proximal muscle weakness, myalgias, bone pain (especially with activity and weight bearing) and hypocalcemic tetany. Labs will show elevated PTH and alkaline phosphatase along with low serum 25(OH)D. Radiographic signs include **Looser zones**
and **pseudofractures**. It should be treated via ergocalciferol (D2) or cholecalciferol (D3) supplementation with initial high dose (50k IU weekly) followed by a lower daily dose after 8-12 weeks (800-2000IU daily). [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551616/)

## Osteopenia

Osteopenia is a decrease in BMD not yet meeting criteria for osteoporosis (T-score between -1 and -2.5). Much more common in females. Same physiologic process and treatment as osteoperosis, though less agressive and pharmacologic therapy should not be started unless there is clinical evidence of fragility fracture.
