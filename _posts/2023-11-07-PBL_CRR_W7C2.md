# Hypertension

- Normal blood pressure – Systolic <120 mmHg and diastolic <80 mmHg
- Elevated blood pressure – Systolic 120 to 129 mmHg and diastolic <80 mmHg
- Hypertension:
    - Stage 1 – Systolic 130 to 139 mmHg or diastolic 80 to 89 mmHg
    - Stage 2 – Systolic at least 140 mmHg or diastolic at least 90 mmHg

All patients should be prescribed lifestyle modifications. Initial pharmacologic therapy should be chosen from the follwing:
- Thiazide-like or thiazide-type diuretics
- Long-acting calcium channel blockers (most often a dihydropyridine such as amlodipine)
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
- Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)

**ACE or ARBS**: diabetic nephropathy or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, especially when complicated by proteinuria.
**Ischemic Heart Disease or HFrEF**: Beta blockers

When more than one agent is needed to control the blood pressure, we recommend therapy with a long-acting ACE inhibitor or ARB in concert with a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a thiazide diuretic can also be used but may be less beneficial when hydrochlorothiazide is used. 

## Renal Artery Stenosis

 - **Atherosclerosis** (60% to 90%): Atherosclerosis primarily affects patients (men over the age of 45 years) and usually involves the aortic orifice or the proximal 2 cm of the main renal artery. This disorder is particularly common in patients who have atherosclerosis, however, can also occur as a relatively isolated renal lesion. Any of the multiple renal arteries (occurring in 14% to 28%) may be affected. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include **dyslipidemia**, cigarette smoking, viral infection, immune injury, and increased homocysteine levels.
 - **Fibromuscular dysplasia** (10% to 30%): In contrast to atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia most often affects women younger than the age of 50 years and typically involves the middle and distal main renal artery or the intrarenal branches.
 - Other less common causes (less than 10%) include thromboembolic disease, arterial dissection, infrarenal aortic aneurysm, vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Buerger disease, polyarteritis nodosa, post radiation), neurofibromatosis type 1, retroperitoneal fibrosis.

In patients with renal artery stenosis, the chronic ischemia produced by the obstruction of renal blood flow leads to adaptive changes in the kidney which include the formation of collateral blood vessels and secretion of renin by juxtaglomerular apparatus. The renin enzyme has an important role in maintaining homeostasis in that it converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I has then converted to angiotensin II with the help of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs. Angiotensin II is responsible for vasoconstriction and release of aldosterone which causes sodium and water retention, thus resulting in secondary hypertension or renovascular hypertension.

### RAAS

Angiotenin II and Aldosterone are vasoconsitrictors and cause sodium/water retention in the kidneys. This causes increased blood volume and peripheral resistance, both of which contribute to systemic and pulmonary hypertension. At a cellular level, angiotensin and aldosterone activate oxidant stress signaling pathways that decrease levels of bioavailable nitric oxide, increase inflammation, and promote cell proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis. Clinically, enhanced renin-angiotensin activity and elevated levels of aldosterone have been detected in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which suggests a role for angiotensin and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in the treatment of PAH and accompanying pulmonary edema.

#### Duplex Doppler US

Direct scanning of the main renal arteries with color or power Doppler US followed by spectral analysis of renal artery flow using an anterior or anterolateral approach. Owing to various factors essentially as gas interposition and the anatomy of the left renal artery, a complete examination of both renal arteries can be achieved in only 50%–90% of cases. Signal enhancement can be achieved by administering contrast agents that facilitate visualization of the renal arteries. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430718/) Four criteria are currently used to diagnose significant proximal stenosis:
1. An increase in peak systolic velocity in the renal artery (the post-stenotic threshold for significant RAS is 100 cm/sec to 200 cm/sec is reported)
2. A renal-to-aortic peak systolic velocity ratio of greater than 3.5
3. Turbulent post-stenotic site
3. Visualization of the renal artery without any detectable Doppler signal, an observation that signals occlusion.

### Management of Renal Artery Stenosis

The management which involves serial control every 6 months with duplex scanning, accurate correction of dyslipidemia, use of drugs that block platelet aggregation, may require three or more different drugs to control hypertension. Preferably angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used for the purpose. Unfortunately, these two classes of drugs can also lead to increased serum creatinine levels and hyperkalemia, limiting their utility. In such a case, calcium channel blockers are a potential replacemet.

## Hypertensive Emergency [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies-in-adults)

Significantly elevated blood pressure (systolic over 180mmHg and/or diastolic over 120 mmHg) usually presents with no acute end-organ damage and does not necessarily require rapid antihypertensive intervention. This is known as **hypertensive urgency**. Hypertensive _emergency_ on the other hand, must be immediatley treated.

Often, "flash" pulmonary edema is related to an acute increase in LV end-diastolic pressure in the setting of hypertensive emergency, acute ischemia, new onset tachyarrhythmia, or obstructive valvular disease. In addition to standard therapies for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, this condition responds well to combined venous and arterial vasodilators.  "Flash" pulmonary edema appears to be more common in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis as compared to those with unilateral disease (eg, 41 versus 12 percent). The combination of bilateral renal artery stenosis and "flash" pulmonary edema has been named the Pickering syndrome. [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema)

### Exam findings

Expected exam findings vary depending on the specific target organ most affected. With cardiac dysfunction, rales may be heard on lung auscultation, jugular venous distention or peripheral edema may be noted, and extra heart sounds may be apparent. In the event of a very rapid onset of hypertension, often seen with sympathomimetic abuse or beta-blocker withdrawl (as seen in this case), marked dyspnea in the absence of peripheral edema due to flash pulmonary edema may be encountered. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470371/)

### Labs and Imaging

Based on clinical suspicion from H&P, the following may be ordered:
- Electrocardiography (MI)
- Conventional chest radiography (pulmonary edema, tamponade, etc.)
- Echocardiogram (underlying heart failure or structural disease)
- Urinalysis, urine pregnancy test (renal damage, preeclampsia)
- Serum electrolytes and serum creatinine (renal deamage)
- Cardiac biomarkers (if an acute coronary syndrome is suspected)
- Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (if head injury, neurologic symptoms, hypertensive retinopathy, nausea, or vomiting are present)
- Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the chest or transesophageal echocardiography (if aortic dissection is suspected, although rapid blood pressure lowering need not be delayed in such patients while awaiting the results of imaging)

### Neurologic Emergencies
- Ischemic Stroke: blood pressure should only be lowered acutley if thrombolytic therapy is indicated. Otherwise, it is reasonable to start or restart HTN medications after patient is neurologically stable with the goal of controlling HTN over a few days to weeks. 
- Hemorrhagic stroke: avoid further bleeding while maintaining perfusion is difficult. IV labetolol and nicardipine are often first line agents.
- Head Trauma: increased intracranial pressure can cause severe HTN. Caution is needed with agressive blood pressure reduction to avoid cutting off perfusion to the brain.
- Hypertensive encephalopathy: headache, confusion, nausea, and vomiting due to vascular fluid diffusion across the blood brain barrier. Requires rapid intervention aiming to reduce pressure by 10-20% within the first hour of treatment. Common treatments in this setting include clevidipine, nicardipine, fenoldopam, and nitroprusside.
    - Failure to treat adequatley can result in vision loss due to hypertensive retinopathy

### Cardiovascular Emergencies
- Acute LV failure: loop diuretics and titratable vasodilators such as nitroprusside or nitroglycerine are indicated to relieve cardiac work. 
- Acute coronary syndrome: lower pressure and myocaridal oxygen demand via metoprolol or esmolol.
- Aortic dissection: reccomendations are to reduce to systolic pressure within 100-120mmHg in 20 minutes folling diagnosis via IV beta blocker and vasodilator (i.e. esmolol + nitroprusside)

### Renal Emergencies
- Severe HTN can cause fibrinoid necrosis of renal arterioles and result in hemeolytic uremic syndrome. This often leads to glomerular ischemia and RAAS activation, exacerbating the hypertension. 
    - Care must be taken with antihypertensives as the drop in blood pressure can lead to acutley worse kideny function. Fenoldopam is the drug of choice.

### Other
- Beta blocker withdrawl may cause acute malignant HTN similar to that of a phenochromocytoma. Treat by reissuing drug.
- Sympathomimmetics (tyramines + MAOIs or amphetamies/cocaine...) can cause acute hypertensive crisis. Should be treated with IV phentolamine (nitroprussie if unavailable)
- Phenocrhomocytoma

## Case Medications


| Drug           | Mechanism of Action    |      Use in HTN with RAS         |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Amlodipine     | Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It inhibits the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced peripheral vascular resistance. This ultimately decreases blood pressure. | Amlodipine can be beneficial in managing chronic hypertension in the presence of renal artery stenosis by relaxing blood vessels, reducing the afterload on the heart, and lowering blood pressure. It helps to improve renal blood flow and reduce the workload on the stenotic kidney. |
| Candesartan    | Candesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It selectively blocks the action of angiotensin II on its receptors, preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone release, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. | Candesartan is effective in managing hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis by antagonizing the effects of angiotensin II, reducing renal vasoconstriction, and improving renal perfusion. |
| Atorvastatin   | Atorvastatin is a statin that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. By reducing cholesterol synthesis, it lowers circulating levels of LDL cholesterol. | Atorvastatin may be used in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis to manage lipid profiles. Lowering LDL cholesterol can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis progression in the renal arteries. |
| Aspirin        | Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of thromboxane A2, a platelet aggregator. | Aspirin is not typically used to manage hypertension directly. However, it may be prescribed in individuals with renal artery stenosis who are at risk of atherosclerotic events, as it helps prevent platelet aggregation and thrombosis, reducing the risk of embolic events. |
| Nitroglycerin  | Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that releases nitric oxide, leading to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and dilation of veins and arteries. | Nitroglycerin can be used to alleviate symptoms of angina in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis, as it reduces myocardial oxygen demand by dilating coronary vessels. However, it is not a primary drug for managing hypertension itself. |
| Furosemide     | Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits the Na-K-2Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. This diuresis reduces blood volume and decreases blood pressure. | Furosemide may be used cautiously in individuals with renal artery stenosis to manage fluid overload and edema. However, it can lead to a decrease in renal blood flow and potentially worsen renal function in some cases. It is not the first-line treatment for hypertension in this context. |

- Formation of a registry to identify and track hypertensive patients
- Treatment algorithms including initial single-pill combinations
- Prompt follow-up of patients with uncontrolled hypertension with medical assistants for blood pressure checks
- Promotion of single-pill combination therapy
- Regular feedback about hypertension control performance provided to local practices and medical director

#### Healthcare Team

**At-Home Nursing**

* Blood Pressure Monitoring: At-home nursing should ensure regular monitoring of blood pressure. The aim is to maintain a target blood pressure to prevent further renal damage. Frequent measurements help in dose adjustments of antihypertensive medications.
* Medication Management: Administering and monitoring the patient's antihypertensive medication regimen is vital. Common choices include ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to target the RAAS system. Adverse effects like hyperkalemia should be closely monitored.
* Patient Education: Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence, potential side effects, and dietary restrictions. Ensure understanding of when to seek medical attention.
* Fluid and Sodium Intake: At-home nursing can supervise the patient's daily fluid and sodium intake. Fluid restriction may be necessary in advanced cases to prevent fluid overload.

**Nutritionist**

* Low-Sodium Diet: A nutritionist should design a low-sodium diet plan to control blood pressure. Reducing salt intake decreases fluid retention and eases the workload on the heart.
* Potassium Management: Since many antihypertensive medications can increase potassium levels, the nutritionist should ensure the patient's diet is balanced in potassium, avoiding hyperkalemia.
* Fluid Intake Control: The nutritionist can help in setting appropriate daily fluid intake limits based on the patient's specific needs and comorbid conditions.
* Healthy Diet: Promote a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This supports overall cardiovascular health.
