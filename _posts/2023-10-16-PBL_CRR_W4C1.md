# Diagnosis - Chest pain

### Pain [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470557/)
Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution - patients will often move their hand around a larger area when localizing. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.

Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.

Reproducible chest wall tenderness (CWT) on palpation of the thorax, where the maximum pain sensation is referred, is generally considered to be associated with a benign musculoskeletal cause and may help to rule out ACS in absence of additional examinations.

### Cardiogenic Shock [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.011991)

CS is caused by severe impairment of myocardial performance that results in diminished cardiac output, end‐organ hypoperfusion, and hypoxia. Clinically this presents as hypotension refractory to volume resuscitation with features of end‐organ hypoperfusion requiring pharmacological or mechanical intervention. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) accounts for 81% of patient in CS (5-8% of STEMI result in CS). [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.106.613596)

![CS post MI](/img/CS_postMI.jpg)

**Criteria**:
* SBP <90 mm Hg for >30 min or supportive intervention to maintain SBP >90 mm Hg
* Evidence of end‐organ damage (AMS, UO <30 mL/h, or cool extremities)

MI with LV failure remains the most common cause of CS. It is critical to exclude complicating factors that may cause shock in MI patients. Chief among these are the mechanical complications: ventricular septal rupture, contained free wall rupture, and papillary muscle rupture. Mechanical complications must be strongly suspected in patients with CS complicating nonanterior MI, particularly a first MI. Echocardiography is the technique of choice to rule out these entities and should be performed early unless the diagnosis is extensive anterior MI and the patient is undergoing prompt percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

## Atherosclerosis [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10146)

The progression from stable angina to a myocardial infarction typically occurs when a previously stable plaque in the coronary artery becomes unstable and ruptures, leading to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) at the site of the rupture. This clot can partially or completely block the artery, resulting in the transition from stable angina to a heart attack.

### Stages

![img](/img/atherosclerosis.png)
**a.** The normal artery contains three layers. The inner layer, the tunica intima, is lined by a monolayer of endothelial cells that is in contact with blood overlying a basement membrane. In contrast to many animal species used for atherosclerosis experiments, the human intima contains resident smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The middle layer, or tunica media, contains SMCs embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Arteries affected by obstructive atherosclerosis generally have the structure of muscular arteries. The arteries often studied in experimental atherosclerosis are elastic arteries, which have clearly demarcated laminae in the tunica media, where layers of elastin lie between strata of SMCs. The adventitia, the outer layer of arteries, contains mast cells, nerve endings and microvessels. **b.** The initial steps of atherosclerosis include adhesion of blood leukocytes to the activated endothelial monolayer, directed migration of the bound leukocytes into the intima, maturation of monocytes (the most numerous of the leukocytes recruited) into macrophages, and their uptake of lipid, yielding foam cells. **c.** Lesion progression involves the migration of SMCs from the media to the intima, the proliferation of resident intimal SMCs and media-derived SMCs, and the heightened synthesis of extracellular matrix macromolecules such as collagen, elastin and proteoglycans. Plaque macrophages and SMCs can die in advancing lesions, some by apoptosis. Extracellular lipid derived from dead and dying cells can accumulate in the central region of a plaque, often denoted the lipid or necrotic core. Advancing plaques also contain cholesterol crystals and microvessels. **d.** Thrombosis, the ultimate complication of atherosclerosis, often complicates a physical disruption of the atherosclerotic plaque. Shown is a fracture of the plaque's fibrous cap, which has enabled blood coagulation components to come into contact with tissue factors in the plaque's interior, triggering the thrombus that extends into the vessel lumen, where it can impede blood flow.

### Pathway

![Chemistry of Atherosclerosis](/img/athero_physio.png)
Atherogenesis begins with the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the intima. Activated endothelial cells express leukocyte adhesion molecules that capture blood monocytes, including (but not exclusively) the pro-inflammatory subset marked by high expression levels of the cell-surface protein Ly6C in mice. After inflammatory activation, monocytes recruited to the intima express scavenger receptors that permit the uptake of modified LDL particles, such as oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Cholesterol loading leads to the formation of foam cells, and ultimately leads to the mature lipid-laden macrophages of the plaque's core. These cells can produce pro-inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, and tissue factor pro-coagulants that amplify local inflammation and promote thrombotic complications. Although fewer in number than the mononuclear phagocytes, T cells also enter the intima and send decisive regulatory signals. After antigen-specific activation, T helper 1 (TH1) cells secrete the signature cytokine interferon-g (IFN-g), which can activate vascular wall cells and macrophages, and magnify and sustain the inflammatory response in the intima. Regulatory T (Treg) cells produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), two cytokines considered to exert anti-inflammatory actions. Although not numerically prominent in the plaque, B cells accumulate and organize in the perivascular tissue surrounding atherosclerotic arteries. They produce circulating antibodies that may limit inflammation and mute atherogenesis. In addition to modified LDL, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) — particularly those particles that bear apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-CIII) or apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) — can instigate vascular inflammation through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signalling. Macrophage foam cells can efflux cholesterol (chol) through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which work in tandem. ABCA1 loads cholesterol-poor nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (pre-β HDL) with cholesterol. ABCG1 can load more mature HDL particles with cholesterol. Having taken up cholesterol through interaction with the ABC transporters in the artery wall, HDL particles can exit through the bloodstream, contributing to reverse cholesterol transport from lesional macrophages to the periphery. VLDL and LDL particles bearing ApoB can unload cholesterol from HDL particles through the action of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Blockade of CETP can thus augment HDL levels, a process not yet known to produce clinical benefit. The ApoB-containing lipoproteins can promote clearance of cholesterol through capture by peripheral LDL receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in the enzyme PCSK9 (not shown) can increase the number of LDL receptors on peripheral cells, thereby augmenting the clearance of LDL.

## Angina [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559016/)

Angina is the result of an imbalance between the myocardial oxygen supply and the myocardial oxygen demand. Endothelial cells line the coronary arteries; these cells are responsible for regulating vascular tone and preventing intravascular thrombosis. Any disruption in these two functions can lead to coronary heart disease. Multiple mechanisms can result in injury or impairment of the endothelial lining. These mechanisms include, but are not limited to, stress, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, viruses, bacteria, and immune complexes. Endothelial injury triggers an immune response, which ultimately leads to fibrous tissue formation. Smooth muscle remodeling/fibrous caps can lead to coronary artery stenosis or even acute coronary syndrome. 

**Coronary artery stenosis is the most common cause of myocardial ischemia.** During times of increased myocardial oxygen demand, the stenosis prevents adequate myocardial oxygen supply. Four main factors contribute to oxygen demand: **heart rate, systolic blood pressure, myocardial wall tension, and myocardial contractility**. In states of increased demand such as illness, stress, and exercise – we rely on the body’s ability to up-regulate myocardial oxygen supply appropriately. 

The four main factors that contribute to **myocardial oxygen supply include coronary artery diameter and tone, collateral blood flow, perfusion pressure, and heart rate**. While coronary artery stenosis is the most common, other conditions can lead to a decreased myocardial oxygen supply. These examples include, but are not limited, to coronary artery vasospasm, embolism, dissection, and micro-vascular disease.

When the myocardial oxygen demand exceeds the myocardial oxygen supply, this will often manifest with symptoms.  **Myocardial ischemia stimulates chemosensitive and mechanoreceptive receptors within the cardiac muscle fibers and surrounding the coronary vessels**. The activation of these receptors triggers impulses through the sympathetic afferent pathways from the heart to the cervical and thoracic spine. Each spinal level has a corresponding dermatome; the discomfort described by the patient will often follow the specific dermatomal pattern.

### Angina to STEMI pipeline

The progression from stable angina to a myocardial infarction typically occurs when a previously stable plaque in the coronary artery becomes unstable and ruptures, leading to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) at the site of the rupture. This clot can partially or completely block the artery, resulting in the transition from stable angina to a heart attack.

Stable angina can also due to continued thickening of atherosclerotic plaque, gradually increasing in severity as more of the vessel is occluded from stable to unstable angina. Once the blood supply is totally occluded, MI results.

#### Coronaries

![Coronary Arteries](/img/Coranaries_angiogram.png)

### Labs
 - CBC will usually be normal
 - Atherosclerosis: _See lipids section above_
 - Troponins will only be present in _NSTEMI_ and _STEMI_

#### Stable Angina Workup
1. Obtain an electrocardiogram to evaluate for active ischemia or evidence of previous infarction. 
2. Obtain a chest x-ray to assist in ruling out noncardiac explanations for chest pain (i.e., infection, trauma, pneumothorax, etc.)
3. Obtain a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and troponin. Lab work is important in risk stratification purposes and ruling out noncardiac explanations (i.e., anemia, infection, renal disease, etc.)
4. Use previous work up to risk stratify, consider stress testing versus further coronary evaluation in moderate to high-risk individuals. 

#### Firstline treatment: modifiable risk factors
* Tobacco cessation will result in the biggest risk reduction. 
    * Cigarette smoking is the leading avoidable cause of premature death. The risk of cardiovascular mortality in current smokers is roughly two times that of nonsmokers. Interestingly enough, the risk of cardiovascular mortality in former smokers is roughly equal to that of individuals who have never smoked. That said, it is imperative to continuously encourage smoking cessation regardless of age or duration of smoking history.
* Cholesterol reduction
    * Evidence has supported that adherence to the Mediterranian diet (high in vegetables and fruits) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.
* Blood pressure control
    * The 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines define hypertension as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg or diastolic pressure ≥80 mmHg. Goal blood pressure will be unique to each patient; however, it is important to keep in mind that for each 20/10 mmHg increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure, evidence has supported a two-fold increased risk of coronary heart and stroke-related mortality.
* Diabetes mellitus management
    * Recommend weight reduction, increased physical activity, and adequate control of comorbidities.
* Weight loss
    * Obesity is the second leading modifiable cause of premature deaths. Weight-loss regimens should be catered to each patient, and the discussion should include lifestyle modifications and surgical options if appropriate. 
* Aerobic exercise
    * An average of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise per week has been shown to decrease overall cardiac risk factors and, in turn, decrease the risk of coronary heart disease.

## Stable Angina Differential

**Cardiovascular**
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Unstable angina: Detailed history is pertinent. Chest pain less likely to follow a predictable pattern, and the patient may even experience chest pain at rest.
* NSTEMI: Elevated cardiac enzymes with or without EKG changes.
* STEMI: Elevated cardiac enzymes with regional ST elevations noted on EKG.
* Myocarditis: Elevated cardiac enzymes with EKG changes.
* Pericarditis: Diffuse ST elevations noted on EKG with or without an elevation in cardiac enzymes. Chest pain is pleuritic and is often relieved with leaning forward. 

![Locations of Infarcts](/img/occlusive_sites.png)

**Gastrointestinal**
* Esophageal spasm: Temporal relationship to meals with or without dysphagia
Gastroesophageal reflux disease: Temporal relationship to meals

**Pulmonary** 
* Asthma: Abnormal lung sounds expected on the exam. Anticipate improvement in symptoms with pulmonary hygiene and inhaled beta-agonists. 
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Abnormal lung sounds expected on the exam. Anticipate improvement in symptoms with pulmonary hygiene and inhaled beta-agonists. 
* Pulmonary embolus: Chest pain pleuritic in nature. Typically, the presentation includes tachycardia and hypoxemia.

**Musculoskeletal** 
* Costochondritis: Chest pain reproducible on the exam. History often reveals recent heavy lifting or exercise.
* Trauma: History reveals the mechanism of trauma. Imaging may reveal fractures.

### Genetic risk factors

**Hypercholesterolemia**
- APOB mutations: lower affinity of VLDL and LDL for LDLR 
- LDLR mutations: most common cause. Cells (esp. liver cells) unable to appropriately reuptake LDL
- LDLRAP1 mutations: failure of interceullar protein that interacts with LDLR in cytoplasm.
- PCSK9 mutation: overactivity causes acclerated LDLR degredation in cytoplasm

### Metoprolol [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532923/)

Metoprolol is a cardioselective (Beta-1) beta blocker. It decreases cardiac output by negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Metoprolol does not exhibit membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Administration of metoprolol to normal subjects results in a reduction in heart rate and cardiac output; this appears to be related to the dose and concentration of the drug. Metoprolol is mainly lipophilic, and distribution is typical of a basic lipophilic drug. 

The Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) trial specifically showed a benefit of metoprolol over diuretics regarding sudden cardiac death as well as myocardial infarction. A large randomized trial of over 50,000 patients in the 1990s showed metoprolol to reduce mortality and re-infarction when used chronically after myocardial infarction.

### Nitroglycerin [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482382/)

As with other nitrates used to treat anginal chest pain, nitroglycerin converts to nitric oxide (NO) in the body. NO then activates the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, which converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle and other tissues. cGMP then activates many protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations, which enhances the reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increases extracellular calcium, and opens the calcium-gated potassium channel.[5][6] This ultimately results in the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains within smooth muscle fibers.[7] This activity causes the relaxation of smooth muscle within blood vessels, resulting in the desired vasodilatory effect.

If anginal pain persists after three doses, prompt medical attention is required. After administration, the onset of vasodilatory effects occurs within 1 to 3 minutes, with a max effect occurring within 5 minutes. Nitroglycerin is primarily eliminated via metabolism in the liver and has a mean half-life of approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

Contraindicated with right sided MI and use of PDE-5 inhibitors (i.e. viagra).

## ACS

![ACS Comparison](/img/ACS_compare.png)

A 1977 study examined blood pressure over the course of MI and found that significant hypertension was seen in a large portion of patients immediatley after presentation. This often subsided spontaneously without any specific HTN medication after several hours. [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002870378901588?via%3Dihub)

![BP in MI](/img/BP_STEMI.png)

### Glyburide and ACS [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23802997/)

Sulfonylureas might increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events; however, emerging evidence suggests there may be important differences amongst these drugs. Some, like glyburide, inhibit KATP channels in the heart and pancreas, while others, like gliclazide, are more likely to selectively inhibit KATP channels in the pancreas. 

#### Localizing STEMI and NSTEMI

![EKG Localizaiton](/img/EKG_MI_localization.PNG)

### PCI

Percutaneous coronary intervention is a non-surgical invasive procedure in which a catheder is inserted through either the femoral or radial artery. It is then guided via fluoroscopy to visualize relevant tissues as it is advanced through the ascending aorta and contrast is injected to identify the occlusion of interest. A balloon is then inflated to compress the plaque and open the vessel after which a stent may or may not be placed. Generally, stenting is associated with better acute and long term outcomes. [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/hc3901.096695)

PCI is indicated in STEMI, refractory or recurrent angina in NSTEMI or NSTEMI with mitral regurgitation, hemodynamic instability, or sustained Vtach, or in highly symptomatic stable or unstable angina. Critical stenosis not qualifying for CABG also should be treated via PCI. Should not be performed in patients with high bleeding risk or with multiple previous PCI restenoses.

Studies have shown improved in-hospital mortality, which showed a shorter door to balloon times. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients in the NRMI-3 and 4 registries (1999 to 2002) who were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within six hours of presentation, longer D2B times were significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality (3.0, 4.2, 5.7, and 7.4 percent for D2B time of less than or equal to 90 minutes, 91 to 120 minutes, 121 to 150 minutes, and greater than 150 minutes, respectively).

# Treatment

### ASCVD Risk

Our patient has 10 year ASCVD risk of 14.5% and a lifetime risk of 50% given the information in the case. The guidelines indicate that moderate-intensity statin should be initiated to reduce LDL-C by 30-49% (class I). For example, we could start them on 40mg daily atorvastatin.

![ASCVD Flowchart](/img/ASCVD.png)

#### Lifestyle factors

The most important lifestyle factors which affect the serum lipid profile are diet composition, body weight and physical activity. The modification of blood lipid levels will be beneficial especially to those who are at higher risk of coronary heart disease. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3860764/)
