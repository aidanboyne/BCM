## Pain

Pain can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. It can be classified by it's physiological etiology or by the length of time it has been present (acute, subacute, or chronic).

Pain begins with first order neurons (pseudounipolar) whose cell bodies lie within the DRG. These synapse with second order neurons and ascend via the **spinothalamic tract**, decussate at the **anterior white commisure**, and synapse with the third order neurons in the **VPL** nucleus of the thalamus. These neurons terminate in the primary somatory cortex (postcentral gyrus).

### Nociceptive Pain

Caused by physical, noxious stimuli such as heat, pressure, or other stimuli causing tissue damage.
- Somatic pain: Dermal or MSK pain localized to the site o finjury. Usually described as dull/sharp or throbbing
- Visceral pain: internal organs or smooth muscle. Can be due to ischemia or distension. Usually referred. Dull, deep, colicky, and often poorly localized. 
- **Inflammatory pain:** Often classified as it's own type of pain, inflammatory pain is not caused due to direct injury. Rather, it is mediated by inflammatory molecules such as IL-1/6, TNF-alpha, leukotrienes, proastaglantins, ROS, vasoactive amines, and substance P. Associated with erythema and swelling.

### Neuropathic pain

Pain arising due to nervous system dysfunction or damage without external stimulus. Includes:
- **Peripheral neuropathic pain**: lesions of peripheral nerves, nerve roots, and DRG which can alter pheriphral signals. Discussed in more detail later in this section.
- Central neuopathic pain: due to lesions in the CNS. Can be due to stroke, infection, demyelination, trauma, and neoplasm. 

Examples of neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpetic neuralgia, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome.

#### Other terminology
- Allodynia: pain produced by normally nonpainful stimuli. Mediated by mechanoreceptors
- Hyperalgesia: pain disproportionate to provokin stimulus. Mediated by nociceptors
- Dysesthesia: unplesant abnormal sensation
- Parasthesia: "pins and needles" or numbness/tingling
- Anesthesia dolorosa: pain in skin region that is otherwise numb 

Many of the above can be a result of peripheral or central sensatization

### Functional pain

Psychogenic origin without demonstrable physical cause/pathology. Usually accompanied by stress, grief, or some psychiatric disease and manifests as headache, abdominal pain, or back pain in many cases. Includes IBS, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular dysfunction. 

## Peripheral Neuropathy

The most common peripheral neuopathy is diabetic neuropathy, followed by cryptogenic axonal, then toxic. Other examples include hereditary disorders, metabolic disturbances, and inflammatory dymptoms. 

### Mononeuropathies
- Median nerve = carpal tunnel syndrome
- Ulnar nerve = tardy ulnar nerve/cubital tunnel syndrome
- Radial nerve = Saturday night palsy
- Others include meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous), piriformis syndrome (sciatic), captain chair/strawberry picker palsy (peroneal), and tarsal tunnel syndrome (tibial).

### Polyneuropathies

**Hereditary**:
- **Charcot-Marie-Tooth**: A group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy, primarily affecting the arms and legs.
- **Hereditary sensory neuropathy**: A rare inherited disorder causing degeneration of sensory nerves, leading to impaired sensation, particularly in the extremities, and an increased risk of injuries due to the lack of pain perception.

**Inflammatory**:
- **Guillain-Barré syndrome**: An acute autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, causing inflammation and demyelination of the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis.
- **Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy**: A chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function due to the inflammation and destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding the peripheral nerves.
- **Vasculitis**: A group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to nerve damage and polyneuropathy due to restricted blood flow.

**Infectious**:
- **Leprosy**: A chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which can lead to nerve damage and polyneuropathy due to the bacteria's affinity for peripheral nerves.
- **HIV**: Human immunodeficiency virus can cause peripheral neuropathy due to direct viral effects, opportunistic infections, or as a side effect of antiretroviral therapy.

**Systemic**:
- **Diabetes Mellitus**: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to nerve damage and polyneuropathy, particularly in poorly controlled or long-standing diabetes.
- **Paraneoplastic**: Certain types of cancer can trigger an autoimmune response against the body's own nerves, leading to paraneoplastic polyneuropathy.
- **Paraproteinemia**: The presence of abnormal proteins (paraproteins) in the blood, often associated with multiple myeloma, can cause nerve damage and polyneuropathy.

**Drugs**:
- **Isoniazid**: An antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which can cause polyneuropathy as a side effect, especially in patients with nutritional deficiencies.
- **Alcohol**: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can lead to nutritional deficiencies (primarily B1 deficiency) and direct toxic effects on the nerves, resulting in polyneuropathy.
- **Chemotherapy drugs**: Certain chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer can cause peripheral nerve damage and polyneuropathy as a side effect.

### Mononeuropathy Multiplex

Caused by a variety of disorders including vasculitis, diabetes, Sjogren's, Leprosy, Amyloid, Sarcoidosis, etc. Rare type of peripheral neuropathy that presents in uncorrelated areas of the body with symptoms that are often asymmetrical and asynchronous

### Treatments
- **SNRIs**: duloxetine and venlafaxine are considered the gold standard for neuropathic pain via the inhibition of norepinepherine and seratonin reuptake within the spinal cord causing inhibition of dorsal horn nociceptive signaling.
- **Anticonvulsants**: The primary mode of action for gabapentin is thought to be the inhibition of auxillary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, decreasing subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. 

## Alcohol Use disorder

Acutely, alcohol consumption can lead to injury from accidents, aggression and violence, and, at high doses, can cause death. Chronic heavy alcohol use contributes to alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and other psychiatric disorders, increases the risk of other medical conditions, including cancers, and is a teratogen during pregnancy.

### Ethanol Metabolism [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720300797)

The metabolism of ethanol increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio, inhibiting the TCA cycle and thus increasing acetyl-CoA usage in ketogenesis and lipogenesis. Excessive consumption can thus lead to lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, fasting hypoglycemia, and hepatosteatosis. The limiting reagent is NAD+, and alcohol dehydrogenase operates via zero-order kinetics.

![Alcohol Metabolism](/img/Alcohol_metabolism.png)

At intoxicating levels, alcohol affects several biological pathways, with effects that vary between individuals and across the lifespan. The initial mechanisms of action of alcohol are not fully understood but proteins are believed to be the primary targets. Among ligand-gated ion channels, glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic receptors directly mediate alcohol effects that, collectively, result in central nervous system (CNS) depression. Specifically, alcohol acutely dampens glutamatergic transmission by reducing calcium ion movement through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Alcohol also directly potentiates GABAergic transmission by increasing chloride movement through GABA-A receptors, and by increasing pre-synaptic GABA release, actions that are putatively responsible for the subjective anxiolytic effects of alcohol. With chronic alcohol use, both glutamatergic and GABAergic effects are associated with the development of marked tolerance. Once tolerance develops, cessation of alcohol intake results in a global CNS hyperexcitability that underlies acute clinical alcohol withdrawal manifestations and contributes to long-term changes in brain function. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-022-00406-1)

Second wave effects include endogenous dopamine, opioid, and endocannabinoid system activation. This is thought to be due to the removal of inhibitory tone from the VTA and nucleus accumbens and results in psychostimulant like action.

Certain genetic variations cause differences in alcohol metabolism. Flushing syndrome is caused by a guanine to adenine substitution in alcohol dehydrogenase and leads to face reddening, dizziness, nausea, and rapid heart rate. 

#### Ethanol Dependence

Longer periods of ethanol exposure and associated chronic suppression of AMPK activity activates regulatory mechanisms, including gene expression, that operate over longer time scales, both in onset and reversal. If chronic alcohol consumption is abruptly ended, metabolism is no longer able to respond rapidly enough to compensate. Glutamatergic neural activity adapts to chronic dysregulation of glutamate metabolism and suppression of glutamatergic neural activity by increasing excitatory and decreasing inhibitory amino acid receptors. A point is reached (ethanol dependence) where withdrawal of ethanol results in significant metabolic energy depletion in neurons and other brain cells as well as hyperexcitation of the glutamatergic system.

Dependency is the result of a progressive transition from positively reinforcing (rewarding) effects to negatively reinforcing (relieving) effects.

### Risk Factors
- ACEs
- Prenatal alcohol exposure
- Hostile or harsh parenting style, or parents who drink heavily
- Male sex

### Diagnosis

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends using the CAGE questionnaire to help identify a patient's potential problem with alcohol. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499856/) CAGE questions include: 

* Have you ever felt you should **Cut Down** on your drinking? 
* Have people **Annoyed** you by criticizing your drinking? 
* Have you ever felt bad or **Guilty** about your drinking? 
* Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (**Eye opener**)?

The DSM-5 calssifies AUD via the following symptoms. 2-3 symptoms indicate mild, 4-5 moderate, and 6+ severe AUD.

1. Alcohol often consumed in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended.
2. A desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.
3. A substantial amount of time spent in activities needed to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from the effects of alcohol.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.
5. Recurrent alcohol use is associated with failure to fulfil responsibilities at work, school or home.
6. Continued alcohol use despite related social or interpersonal problems.
7. Stopping or reducing social, occupational or recreational activities due to alcohol use.
8. Recurrent alcohol use in physically hazardous situations.
9. Continued alcohol use despite knowledge of a physical or psychological problem likely to be caused or exacerbated by alcohol.
10. Tolerance, defined by either a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect or a markedly reduced effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol.
11. Withdrawal, manifesting as either the alcohol withdrawal syndrome or alcohol, or a closely related drug, is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### Medical Consequences

- **Psychiatric disorders**: comorbid with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, BPD, and antisocial personality disorders. Also can cause alcohol induced psyschosis. 
- **Acute consequences**: motor vehicle accidents and assults are the major cause of alcohol related injury. 
- **Infectious disease**: alcohol is linked to increased incidence and worse progression of several diseases including LRI, HIV/sexually transmitted infections, and TB.
- **Chronic Disease and Cancer**
    - Cirrhosis: implicated in about half of all liver cirrhosis. See [this previous PBL case](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/posts/PBL_EGGS_W2C2/#cirrhosis-and-portal-hypertension) for more details on cirrhosis
    - Pancreatitis
    - Cardiovascular disease and hypertension
    - Cancer: grade 1 carcinogen for liver, mouth, throat, esophagus, bowel, and female breast cancer
- **Neurologic disease**: malnutrition can lead to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency leading to the neurological conditions of Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Other neuological consequences include:
    - Marchiafava–Bignami
    - Central pontine myelinosis
    - Cortical shrinkage
    - _Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders_

### B12 [[ref]](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-B12)

B12 is an essential cofactor for **methionine synthase** which, along with a folate complex, converts homocystine to methionine (see pathway in folate section). It is also an essential cofactor for **L-methylmalonyl-conenzyme A mutase** which forms succinyl-CoA at the end of a pathway. This is essential for lipid and protein metabolism and the _synthesis of hemoglobin_. 

#### Absorbtion and Deficiency

In healthy adults, overt vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon, mainly because total body stores can exceed 2,500 μg, daily turnover is slow, and dietary intake of only 2.4 μg/day is sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is present in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish (including shellfish), and to a lesser extent, dairy products and eggs. Strict vegetarians who eat no animal products (vegans) need supplemental vitamin B12 to meet their requirements. A few plant-source foods, such as certain fermented beans and vegetables and edible algae and mushrooms, may contain bioactive vitamin B12.

Absorption of vitamin B12 from food requires normal function of the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine. Stomach acid and enzymes free vitamin B12 from food, allowing it to bind to R-protein found in saliva and gastric fluids. In the alkaline environment of the small intestine, R-proteins are degraded by pancreatic enzymes, freeing vitamin B12 to bind to intrinsic factor (IF), a protein secreted by parietal cells. Receptors on the surface of the terminal ileum take up the IF-B12 complex only in the presence of calcium, which is supplied by the pancreas. Vitamin B12 can also be absorbed by passive diffusion, but this process is very inefficient — only about 1% to 2% of the oral vitamin B12 dose is absorbed passively. The prevalent causes of vitamin B12 deficiency
1. Pernicious anemia: progressive autoimmune destrution of stomach lining including anti-IF-Ab. Requires treatment with IM B12. 
2. Food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption: usually due to atrophy and reduced acid production by the stomach. 

Both are associated with atrophic gastritis, which can be caused by H. pylori infection or stomach autoantibodies. There are also rare inhereted disorders, malabsorbtion syndromes such as celiac and tropical sprue, and lifestyle (veganism, alcoholism, strict vegetarianism) related causes of B12 deficiency.

#### Megaloblastic Anemia

Impaired B12 dependent metabolic activity results in elevated homocystine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the blood and urine. Inadequate THF regeneration traps folate in an unusable form resulting in symptoms of folate deficiency even with adequate folate. This is most apparent in rapidly dividing cells such as RBCs and RBCs. Impaired DNA synthesis results in large, immature RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils along with overall pancytopenias. 

#### Neurologic Symptoms

Neurologic complications are not always associated with megaloblastic anemia and are the only clinical symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency in about 25% of cases. Although vitamin B12 deficiency is known to damage the myelin sheath covering cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves, the biochemical processes leading to neurologic damage in vitamin B12 deficiency are not yet fully understood.

- **Peripheral Neuropathy**: more commonly in feet. 
- Gait ataxia
- Memory loss and other cognitive/mood impairements


### Folate (B9)

Folic acid and folates are precursors to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which in turn acts as a methyl group donor for the re-methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Folate deficiency thus leads indirectly to elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations. Folate deficiency also results in lower concentrations of S-adenosyl methionine, an important methyl group donor for epigenetic processes (gene methylation) and for basic processes of cell metabolism (DNA synthesis, protein synthesis). Folate is also needed for purine and thymidine nucleotides. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535377/) Fresh fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate, but cooking decreases folate content in these foods because natural folates are chemically labile. It is primarily absorbed in the jejunum.

![folate](/img/folate_metabolism.jpg)

The classic association with folate deficiency is neural tube defects (NTD). Proposed mechanisms include accumulation of homocystine and associated lack of DNA methylation or imparied dTMP synthesis. Low folate also increases risk for colon cancer. It can also mask B12 deficiency. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15298442/)


### Thiamine (B1) and Wernicke's Encephalopathy

Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is a severe and life-threatening illness resulting from vitamin B1 deficiency. If untreated, korsakoff psychosis and death my follow.

#### Pathophysiology

Alcoholism causes low thiamine uptake, absorbtion at the mucosal level, and impaired utilizaiton. Other situations where B1 may be deficient include GI procedures/starvation, hyperemesis gravidarum, chemo, hyperthyroidism, some inflammatory diseases, and certain genetic conditions which inactivate the thiamine transporter.

Thiamine is a key vitamin in the maintenance of membrane integrity and osmotic gradients across cell membranes and is stored in body tissues predominantly as thiamine diphosphate (TDP). TDP participates in energy production as an essential cofactor for several enzymes in the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathways. These are key for the generation of ATP, nucelic acid synthesis, and NADPH.

![Thiamine Pathways](/img/Thiamine_pathways.webp)

Depletion of TDP results in depletion of ATP and low DNA/NADPH production, resulting in oxidative stress and accumulation of toxic intermediates which cause cytotoxic edema and excesssive gluatamate release by neurons. The BBB also begins to dysfunction as astrocytes are damaged, causing vasogenic edema.

#### Presentation

Classically, WE presents with a triad of abnormal mental state, ataxia, and opthalmoplegia. However, the full triad is only found in 16-33% of patients with the disease. It is typically associated with chronic alcoholism but up to 50% of cases present in non-alcoholic patients. Mental changes include confusion, spatial disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, apathy, cognitive impairment with disturbance in memory and inability to concentrate, while the most common opthalmic sign is horizontal nystagmus. Gait ataxia is highly variable. [[ref]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11604-020-00989-3)

#### Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically shows abnormal intensity alteration in bilaterally symmetrical lesions in the paraventricular regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal region and floor of the fourth ventricle. MRI also shows unusual sites of brain lesions such as the putamen, caudate, splenium of the corpus callosum, dorsal medulla, pons, red nucleus, substantia nigra of the midbrain, cranial nerve nucleus, vermis, dentate nucleus, paravermian region of the cerebellum, fornix and pre- and postcentral gyri. 

#### Prognosis

WE is very dangerous, resulting in death in up to 20% of patients and Korsakoff syndrome in up to 85% of survivors. Korsakoff is charactereized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia with confabulation due to lesions in the dorsal thalamus and mammillary bodies.

#### Other disorders of low B1

Thiamine deficiency can also present other clinical manifestations such as dry beriberi (neuropathy), wet beriberi (neuropathy with high-output congestive heart failure), and gastrointestinal beriberi (abdominal pain, vomiting, and lactic acidosis).
