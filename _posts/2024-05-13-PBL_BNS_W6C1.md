### B12 [[ref]](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-B12)

B12 is an essential cofactor for **methionine synthase** which, along with a folate complex, converts homocystine to methionine (see pathway in folate section). It is also an essential cofactor for **L-methylmalonyl-conenzyme A mutase** which forms succinyl-CoA at the end of a pathway. This is essential for lipid and protein metabolism and the _synthesis of hemoglobin_. 

#### Absorbtion and Deficiency

In healthy adults, overt vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon, mainly because total body stores can exceed 2,500 μg, daily turnover is slow, and dietary intake of only 2.4 μg/day is sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is present in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish (including shellfish), and to a lesser extent, dairy products and eggs. Strict vegetarians who eat no animal products (vegans) need supplemental vitamin B12 to meet their requirements. A few plant-source foods, such as certain fermented beans and vegetables and edible algae and mushrooms, may contain bioactive vitamin B12.

Absorption of vitamin B12 from food requires normal function of the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine. Stomach acid and enzymes free vitamin B12 from food, allowing it to bind to R-protein found in saliva and gastric fluids. In the alkaline environment of the small intestine, R-proteins are degraded by pancreatic enzymes, freeing vitamin B12 to bind to intrinsic factor (IF), a protein secreted by parietal cells. Receptors on the surface of the terminal ileum take up the IF-B12 complex only in the presence of calcium, which is supplied by the pancreas. Vitamin B12 can also be absorbed by passive diffusion, but this process is very inefficient — only about 1% to 2% of the oral vitamin B12 dose is absorbed passively. The prevalent causes of vitamin B12 deficiency
1. Pernicious anemia: progressive autoimmune destrution of stomach lining including anti-IF-Ab. Requires treatment with IM B12. 
2. Food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption: usually due to atrophy and reduced acid production by the stomach. 

Both are associated with atrophic gastritis, which can be caused by H. pylori infection or stomach autoantibodies. There are also rare inhereted disorders, malabsorbtion syndromes such as celiac and tropical sprue, and lifestyle (veganism, alcoholism, strict vegetarianism) related causes of B12 deficiency.

#### Megaloblastic Anemia

Impaired B12 dependent metabolic activity results in elevated homocystine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the blood and urine. Inadequate THF regeneration traps folate in an unusable form resulting in symptoms of folate deficiency even with adequate folate. This is most apparent in rapidly dividing cells such as RBCs and RBCs. Impaired DNA synthesis results in large, immature RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils along with overall pancytopenias. 

#### Neurologic Symptoms

Neurologic complications are not always associated with megaloblastic anemia and are the only clinical symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency in about 25% of cases. Although vitamin B12 deficiency is known to damage the myelin sheath covering cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves, the biochemical processes leading to neurologic damage in vitamin B12 deficiency are not yet fully understood.

- Gait ataxia
- Memory loss and other cognitive/mood impairements


### Folate (B9)

Folic acid and folates are precursors to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which in turn acts as a methyl group donor for the re-methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Folate deficiency thus leads indirectly to elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations. Folate deficiency also results in lower concentrations of S-adenosyl methionine, an important methyl group donor for epigenetic processes (gene methylation) and for basic processes of cell metabolism (DNA synthesis, protein synthesis). Folate is also needed for purine and thymidine nucleotides. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535377/) Fresh fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate, but cooking decreases folate content in these foods because natural folates are chemically labile.

The classic association with folate deficiency is neural tube defects (NTD). Proposed mechanisms include accumulation of homocystine and associated lack of DNA methylation or imparied dTMP synthesis. Low folate also increases risk for colon cancer. It can also mask B12 deficiency. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15298442/)


### Thiamine (B1) and Wernicke's Encephalopathy

Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is a severe and life-threatening illness resulting from vitamin B1 deficiency. If untreated, korsakoff psychosis and death my follow.

#### Pathophysiology

Alcoholism causes low thiamine uptake, absorbtion at the mucosal level, and impaired utilizaiton. Other situations where B1 may be deficient include GI procedures/starvation, hyperemesis gravidarum, chemo, hyperthyroidism, some inflammatory diseases, and certain genetic conditions which inactivate the thiamine transporter.

Thiamine is a key vitamin in the maintenance of membrane integrity and osmotic gradients across cell membranes and is stored in body tissues predominantly as thiamine diphosphate (TDP). TDP participates in energy production as an essential cofactor for several enzymes in the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathways. These are key for the generation of ATP, nucelic acid synthesis, and NADPH.

Depletion of TDP results in depletion of ATP and low DNA/NADPH production, resulting in oxidative stress and accumulation of toxic intermediates which cause cytotoxic edema and excesssive gluatamate release by neurons. The BBB also begins to dysfunction as astrocytes are damaged, causing vasogenic edema.

#### Presentation

Classically, WE presents with a triad of abnormal mental state, ataxia, and opthalmoplegia. However, the full triad is only found in 16-33% of patients with the disease. It is typically associated with chronic alcoholism but up to 50% of cases present in non-alcoholic patients. Mental changes include confusion, spatial disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, apathy, cognitive impairment with disturbance in memory and inability to concentrate, while the most common opthalmic sign is horizontal nystagmus. Gait ataxia is highly variable. [[ref]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11604-020-00989-3)

#### Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically shows abnormal intensity alteration in bilaterally symmetrical lesions in the paraventricular regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal region and floor of the fourth ventricle. MRI also shows unusual sites of brain lesions such as the putamen, caudate, splenium of the corpus callosum, dorsal medulla, pons, red nucleus, substantia nigra of the midbrain, cranial nerve nucleus, vermis, dentate nucleus, paravermian region of the cerebellum, fornix and pre- and postcentral gyri. 

#### Prognosis

WE is very dangerous, resulting in death in up to 20% of patients and Korsakoff syndrome in up to 85% of survivors. Korsakoff is charactereized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia with confabulation due to lesions in the dorsal thalamus and mammillary bodies.

#### Other disorders of low B1

Thiamine deficiency can also present other clinical manifestations such as dry beriberi (neuropathy), wet beriberi (neuropathy with high-output congestive heart failure), and gastrointestinal beriberi (abdominal pain, vomiting, and lactic acidosis).
