# Adaptive Immune System

The adaptive immune repsonse is carried out by T and B-cells, both of which derive from lymphoid precursors and mature in the thymus and bone marrow respectivley. T-cells express a unique TCR and are activated by APCs which engage the TCR alongside a costimulatory signal in the form of an MHC molecule carrying an antigen (MHCI (endogenous) or MHCII (exogenous) binding CD8 and CD4).

The principal function of B cells is the production of antibodies against foreign antigens which requires their further differentiation. Under certain circumstances, B cells can also act as APCs.

When activated by foreign antigens to which they have an appropriate antigen specific receptor, B cells undergo proliferation and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells (see Fig. 2). Memory B cells are “long-lived” survivors of past infection and continue to express antigen-binding receptors. These cells can be called upon to respond quickly by producing antibodies and eliminating an antigen upon re-exposure. Plasma cells, on the other hand, are relatively short-lived cells that often undergo apoptosis when the inciting agent that induced the immune response is eliminated. However, these cells produce large amounts of antibody that enter the circulation and tissues providing effective protection against pathogens.

![IG and functions](/img/IGs.PNG)

Noteably, only IgG can cross the placenta in significant quantaties. Immune cells such as B and T lymphocytes, regulatory cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells and IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies are found in the breast milk.

## Immune Deficiencies

### B-cells

#### X-linked (Burton's) Agammaglobulinemia

Failure of B-cell precursors to become B-cells as light chains are not produced to a defect in Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). Symptoms begin after loss of maternal antibodies around 6 months of age. They present with recurrent repiratory bacterial infections (otitis media, sinusitis/pneumonia) due to loss of Ab opsonization of encapsulated bacteria such as H. Flu and Strep Pneumo. GI infections with echovirus, polio, coxacie, and giardia are common due to IgA loss. Absence of mature B cells (CD19,20, BCR) absent in blood, underdeveloped germinal centers of lymph nodes, and absense of antibodies are lab findings. Treat with IVIG.

#### Selective IgA Deficiency

Relativley common in US (1/600) due to defective IgA producing B-cells with unknown mechanism. Usually asymptomatic, but may present with recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections. Giardia is also a big GI issue. Anaphylaxis is possible with blood transfusion as IgA may exist in the blood products. SLE and RA are common in people with IgA deficiency.

Diagnosed with IgA < 7mg/dL with normal IgG and IgM. Treatment with prophylactic antibiotics and IVIG is standard. One odd feature is that heterophile Ab produced in these patients test positive for beta-HCG pregnancy tests (about 30%).

#### Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)

Defective B-cell maturation causes loss of plasma cells and Ab. Many genetic causes and often sporadic. Presents with normal B-cell count but absence of Ab (usually IgG, sometimes IgA and IgM as well). Patients may present with recurrent repiratory bacterial infections, enteroviruses, and giardiasis like X-linked agammaglobulinemia. However, it is not X-linked and has a later onset (20-45). They also have high frequency of RA, pernicious anemia, and lymphoma. 

### T-Cells

#### DiGeorge Syndrome

Failure of 3rd/4th pharyngeal pouche to form causing thymic aplasia. Typically due to spontaneous 22q11 chromosomal deletion. This causes loss of T-cells, loss of parathyroid glands (with ensuing hypocalcemia and tetany), and conotruncal heart defects (i.e. abnormal aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, TET Fallot, and ASD/VSDs). 

Immune symptoms include recurrent infections (viral, fungal, protozoal, intracellular) which may improve with age. Patients also often have cleft palate and/or mandible problems. They have absent thymus on CXR (like SCID), low T-cell counts, and underdeveloped T-cell strucutres (paracortex in lymph nodes, peri-arteriolar sheaths in spleen). Thymus or HSC transplants are potential treatments.

#### Hyper IgE Syndrome (Job's)

Rare syndrome due to defective CD4+ Th17 cells which fail to produce IL-17. There is also a loss of neutrophil attraction, likley due to STAT3 signaling pathway defect which prevents appropriate resonse to cytokines. 

Clinially, we see overproduction of IgE and a loss of IFN-gamma but the interactions are not understood. Findings include diffuse eczema in the first few weeks of life with lots of histamine release and itching. Cold staph abscesses on the face and scalp without the typical warmth due to cytokine issues. Recurrent sinusitis, otitis, facial deformities (broad nasal bridge) and retained primary teeth are other signs.  

#### Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis

Defect in AIRE genes. AIRE associates with dectin-1 receptor which responds to candida. It also promotes self antigen production in the thymus, so there is abnormal self antigen presentation to T-cells causing them to attack parathyroid and adrenal glands. There is a decrease of IL2 and IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokines) and an increase in IL10.

Patients have chronic thrush and candida in skin and esophagus. Children present with recurrent thrush, diaper rash, and hypoparathyroidism with adrenal failure. 

#### Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)

Loss of cell and humoral-mediated immunity. Usually a primary T-cell problem with subsequent failure of B-cell stimulation. There is a loss of thymic shadow and loss of germinal centers in nodes. Patients are susceptible to many infections (thrush, bacterial, viral, fungal...). Death in childhood without bone marrow transplant.

Most forms are X-linked (mutation of gamma subunit of IL2RG cytokine receptor). Another defect includes adenosine deaminase gene deficiency. Patients have high levels of dATP which are believed to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase resulting in reduced DNA synthesis and thus immune cell production.  Newborns are screened via TRECs (circular DNA formed by T-cells developing in thymus).

#### Ataxia Telangiectasia

Autosomal recessive ATM mutation on **chr11** which is responsible for repairing double stranded DNA breaks via NHEJ leading to high susceptibility to damage from ionizing radiation. Includes CNS (ataxia), skin (telangiectasias), and immune (infections/malignancies) findings. Progresses from childhood.

Patients typically present with unsteady gait in first year of life. They also have repeated sinus/respiratory infections and are at high risk for lymphoma. Labs include elevated AFP and low IgA.

#### Hyper-IgM Syndrome

B-cells cannot bind T-cells (CD40-CD40L) and thus cannot class switch. Usually (70%) a T-cell CD40L issue: B-cells must bind appropriate antigen with MHC2 and link TCR along with CD28-B7 and CD40L-CD40 binding. Labs show high IgM. Usually X-linked. 

Patients often present with encapsulated bacterial infections (S. pneumo, H. flu) due to lack of IgG opsonization. May also present with opportunistic infections. 

#### Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome

X-linked disorder of WAS gene: abnormal T-cell cytoskeleton causing improper T-cell reaction to APCs. Presents after maternal antibodies fade around 6 months, can worsen with age and includes immune dysfunction, _low platlets_, and eczema. Labs include elevated IgE and IgA. It is treated with bone marrow transplant.

### Genetic Disorders of the Innate Immune System

#### Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency

Defective _neutrophil_ and lymphocyte migration
- **Type I**: Autosomal recessive defective CD18 (LFA1) - no beta subunit of some integrins thus lack of rolling and migration. Classically presents with delayed separation of umbilical cord stump and stump infection (omphalitis). Also can have recurrent bacterial infections and neutrophilia. 
- **Type II**: Lack of Sialyl Lewis X epitope in neutrophils and other lymphocytes makes it impossible for them to bind endothelial selectins and migrate into tissues.

#### Chediak-Higashi Syndrome

Microtubular dysfunction due to LYST gene mutation. Failure of lysosomes to fuse with fagosomes. Also have oculocutaneous albanism due to melanin transport issues. Children present with recurrent staph and strep and if they survive, they have severe peripheral neuropathy and need wheelchairs.

#### Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)

Loss of function in NADPH oxidase which converts oxygen to oxygen radicals (and eventually H202 and bleach) - lots of catalase (+) infections (Staph A, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Nocardia, Aspergillus) becuase there is no H202 for immune system to use for respiratory burst. 

## Diagnosing Immune Deficiency
* **Quantitative serum immunoglobulin levels**: serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA can be ordered in the evaluation of suspected humoral immunodeficiencies. Values for all immunoglobulin levels for paediatric patients must be compared with normal laboratory values for age. The normal term infant has undetectable levels of IgA and IgM at birth and these levels rise progressively in the first 2–3 years of life. IgA levels increase with age and are often elevated in the elderly. Levels of immunoglobulins can also be hightened or lowered in several acquired conditions listed in the table below:

![Ig defs](/img/abnormal_igs.PNG)

![Ig excess](/img/abnormal_inc_igs.PNG)

* **Serum-specific antibody titers**: ELISAs with antigens of interest can be used to quantify the body's immune response to inffection and to known immunizations. Lack of response to immunizations may indicate a humoral immunodeficiency.

## Treatments
* **IVIG**: Immunoglobulins are subdivided into classes (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgM, and IgG) based on their heavy chain. IgG is subdivided into various subclasses, i.e., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 (in order of decreasing abundance), and IgA into IgA1 and IgA2. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin with a plasma concentration range of 700-1600 mg/dL, and this constitutes about 75% to 80% of the immunoglobulins. IgA constitutes about 15% of the immunoglobulins at a plasma concentration of 70-400 mg/dL, whereas IgM has a range of 40-230 mg/dL in the plasma. It has a half life of 33-36 days, but effects often last much longer. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554446/#)
    * IVIG is comprised primarily of IgG pooled from 1000 to 100k different donors to provide coverage against a wide variety of potential pathogens, with very little IgA and almost none of the other antibodies.
    * In humoral immunodeficiencies, IVIG substitutes for the lack of IgG and provides normal humoral immune function. The typical dose is about 4-600 mg/kg/month.
    * In autoimmune conditions, high-dose IVIG paradoxically reverses the effect of harmful circulating antibodies by binding the offending antigens, complement, blocking activation of autoantibodies, and inhibiting inflammatory components of the innate immune system such as monocytes and granulocytes. The typical dose is 1-3000 mg/kG, but is modified based on the clinical situation.
    * Adverse effects include headache, chills, fever, and fatigue (thought to be due to stabilizers in preparation). 
* Marrow Transplants
* Thymus Transpants 


### Case Specific Topics
* **Depressed Fontanelle**: At birth, the newborn's skull consists of five major bones (two frontal, two parietal, and one occipital) that are separated by connective tissue junctions known as cranial sutures. Fontanelles, often referred to as "soft spots," are one of the most prominent anatomical features of the newborn's skull. Six fontanelles are present during infancy, with the most notable being the anterior and posterior fontanelles. Fontanelle morphology may vary between infants, but characteristically they are flat and firm. Certain conditions such as dehydration or infection can alter the appearance of the fontanelles, causing them to sink or bulge, respectively. The average closure time of the anterior fontanelle ranges from 13 to 24 months, while the posterior fontanelle typically closes within 6-8 weeks.

* **Common Daycare Infections** [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329018/)
    * Respiratory: The viruses causing respiratory disease in childcare centers are the same ones causing disease in the community and include the following viruses: respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 1-2, parainfluenza 3, influenza A, and influenza B.
    * GI: The most common causes of childcare-associated outbreaks include Giardia, Cryptosporidium, rotavirus, and other enteric viruses. Outbreaks of Shigella and Escherichia coli O147:H7 infection also occur with some frequency and are a cause for concern.
    * Other: CMV, parvovirus-19, and adenovirus causing pink-eye are other diseases of concern.
