### Arrhythmias

Arrhythmias can cause pathologically high heart rates via abberant conduction (in this case bypassing the AV node via accessory pathway). As a result, ventricles lack time to fill properly, leading to reduced cardiac output and low blood pressures that can lead to syncope.

Symptomatic arrhythmias usually present with palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, fainting, dyspnea, cheast discomfort, and/or weakness/fatigue.

#### Supraventricular arrhythmias

* Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
    * Pathophysiology: Irregular electrical impulses from multiple atrial sources disrupt normal atrial contraction. Rapid, irregular ventricular response results from the atria not contracting effectively.
    * Clinical Features: Palpitations, fatigue, stroke risk due to atrial thrombi.

* Atrial Flutter
    * Pathophysiology: Rapid atrial contractions in a regular, repetitive pattern (typically 250-350 bpm), causing ventricular response at a slower rate.
    * Clinical Features: Palpitations, reduced cardiac output.

* Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)
    * Pathophysiology: Rapid, regular heart rhythms originating above the ventricles, often involving the atria or atrioventricular node.
    * Clinical Features: Palpitations, rapid pulse, often benign but can cause hemodynamic instability.

#### Ventricular arrhythmias

* Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)
    * Pathophysiology: Originates in the ventricles, often due to scar tissue or ischemia. Can be sustained (>30 seconds) or nonsustained (<30 seconds).
    * Clinical Features: Syncope, hemodynamic instability, risk of degenerating into ventricular fibrillation.

* Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)
    * Pathophysiology: Chaotic, rapid ventricular electrical activity with no coordinated contractions, leading to cardiac arrest.
    * Clinical Features: Sudden loss of consciousness, no pulse, and absence of blood pressure.

* Short QT Syndrome (SQTS)
    * Pathophysiology: Shortened QT interval on the ECG.
    * Clinical Features: Increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, especially during episodes of increased heart rate or sympathetic stimulation.

* Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)
    * Pathophysiology: Delayed repolarization of ventricular cells, leading to a prolonged QT interval on ECG. Can result in torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death.
    * Clinical Features: Syncope, palpitations, sudden cardiac arrest.

* Brugada Syndrome
    * Pathophysiology: Genetic sodium channelopathy leading to ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
    * Clinical Features: Syncope, sudden cardiac death, often asymptomatic until arrhythmias occur.

* Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)
    * Pathophysiology: Abnormal calcium handling in cardiac cells, leading to ventricular tachycardia triggered by physical or emotional stress.
    * Clinical Features: Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.

#### Bradyarrythmias/Junctional Rhythms

* Bradycardia
    * Pathophysiology: Slow heart rate (<60 bpm), often due to issues with the sinoatrial node (SA node) or atrioventricular node (AV node).
    * Clinical Features: Fatigue, dizziness, syncope, reduced cardiac output.

* Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome
    * Pathophysiology: Accessory pathway (Bundle of Kent) allows abnormal electrical conduction, leading to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias.
    * Clinical Features: Palpitations, rapid pulse, risk of atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation.

### Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554437/)

The most common arrhythmia associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is called **paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia**. Most cases of WPW syndrome are not inherited, however, familial WPW syndrome typically follows an autosomal dominant pattern.

#### Pathophysiology

The accessory pathway is thought to arise from camber myocardium during improper early atrial and ventricular folding in cardiac embryoenesis. This results in abnormal electrical conduction, allowing cardiac electrical activity to bypass the atrioventricular node conduction delay, and arrive early at the ventricle, leading to premature ventricular depolarization. This preexcitation also bypasses the fast conducting His-Purkinje system and results in early but slowly propagated ventricular depolarization, which gives rise to the ECG pattern of a short PR interval with a “slurred” start to the QRS complex termed a delta wave. The remainder of a normal QRS obliterates this delta wave as the normal cardiac conduction catches up following AV node delay and fast conduction through the His-Purkinje system.

The accessory pathway can also allow the conduction of arrhythmias generated elsewhere to spread immediatley to the ventricles. This predisposes patients with WPW syndrome to sudden cardiac death from ventricular flutter.

WPW syndrome is associated with the Ebstein anomaly: a rare congenital malformation of the tricuspid, which is also located lower than usual

#### Diagnosis
* **ECG**: short PR interval (<120 ms), prolonged QRS complex (>120 ms) and QRS morphology consisting of a slurred delta wave. The preexcitation of the ventricle causes this morphology through the accessory pathway that forms a fusion complex with the normal QRS complex arising from normal cardiac conduction.

* Echocardiogram: used to rule out arrhythmia due to structural abnormalities. Can also evaluate cardiac function if symptoms are active.

## Treatments

* Vagal maneuvers: actions such as coughing, bearing down as if having a bowel movement or putting an ice pack on the face - techniques used to increase vagal parasympathetic tone in an attempt to diagnose and treat various arrhythmias. They are often utilized first in an effort to abort episodes of stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or differentiate SVT from ventricular tachycardias (VT).

* Medications: asymoptomatic patients are usually not treated. Antiarrhythmics are considered for high risk patients. In this specific case, atenolol, a cardioselective beta-1-blocker, is used to temporarily to manage symptoms while awaiting catheter ablation by slowing the heart rate and reducing the risk of tachyarrhythmias, providing symptomatic relief.

* Cardioversion. 
    * **Chemical**:
        - AF
            - Flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone: blockerssodium channels and delaying electrical conduction in the atria. Used in patients without structural defects or significant proarrythmia risk factors
            - Amiodarone: targets multiple ion channels, generally quite effective
            - Ibutilide: prolonging the action potential duration in the atria
        - SVT
            - Adenosine: used in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). It acts by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, briefly interrupting the reentrant circuit responsible for the tachycardia. Can cause transient asystole
            - Verapamil: calcium channel blocker
    * **Electrical:** Paddles or patches on the chest are used to electrically shock the heart and help reset the heart rhythm

* Catheter ablation. In this procedure, the health care provider inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and guides it to the heart. Sometimes more than one catheter is used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter use heat (radiofrequency energy) to create tiny scars in the heart. The scar tissue permanently blocks faulty electrical signals, restoring a regular heartbeat. Catheter ablation doesn't require surgery to access the heart, but it may also be done at the same time as other heart surgeries.

### Atrial Fibrillation Etiology [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526072/)

* Advanced age
* Congenital heart disease
* Underlying heart disease - valvular disease, coronary artery disease, structural heart disease, atrial ischemia
* Increased alcohol consumption
* Hypertension - systemic or pulmonary
* Endocrine disorders - diabetes, pheochromocytoma, and hyperthyroidism
* Genetic factors
* Neurologic disorders - subarachnoid hemorrhage or stroke
* Hemodynamic stress - mitral or tricuspid valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary embolism
* Obstructive sleep apnea
* Inflammation - myocarditis and pericarditis

Any condition that leads to inflammation, stress, damage, or ischemia affecting the anatomy of the heart can result in the development of atrial fibrillation. In some cases, the cause is iatrogenic. Cardiac remodeling, particularly of atria, results in structural and electrical changes that eventually become the cause of deranged rhythm in AF. 

# Diagnosis

### Differential
15y.o. white male, otherwise healthy presenting with palpitations, chest pain, and dizziness.
- Paroxymal supraventricular tachycardia
- Cardiac tamponade (typically with JVD)
- Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
- Mitral valve prolapse
- Generalized anxiety

#### Reading ECG

Each small box is **0.04** seconds and each large box is **0.2** seconds. 

* **HR**: Count large squares within one R-R interval. Divide 300 by this number for HR
    - Each rythm strip is typically 10 seconds
* **Regularity**: check consecutive of R-R intervals for consistency. 
* **Blocks**: Check atrial (p-wave) and ventricular (QRS) rhytms separatley and see if PR interval changes or there is dissociation between QRS and P wave
    - First Degree Block (AV block): **Prolonged** PR (>200ms or 1 small box as measured from beginning of P wave to initial dip in QRS complex)
    - Second degree block (AV block) type I: **progressive** PR interval with prolongation leading up to dropped QRS... repeating
    - Second degree block type II: consitent PR interval with **intermittent** dropped QRS complex (typically 3:1 or 4:1)
    - Third degree block (complete AV block): no communication between atria and ventricals. P waves and QRS complexes **completley disassociated**. Function maintaned by junctional or ventricular pacemaker.
        - Narrow-complex escape rhythm: QRS < 0.12s originating above bifurcation of bundle of His
        - Broad-complex escape rhythm: QRS > 0.12s originating below bifurcation
    - A **shortened** PR interval indicates P wave either originates closer to AV node (can be completley normal with small heart) or there is an accessory pathway i.e. the WPW syndrome (can be associated with delta wave)
    - **Bundle branch blocks**: Broad QRS.
        - Left BBB: W shaped V1 (I don't really see this but ok) and M shaped V6
        - Right BBB: M shpaed V1 and W shaped V6 
* **Deviation**: typically, _lead II_ will have most positive deflection.
    - Right axis devitation presents with most positive deflection in _lead III_
    - Left axis deviation presents with _positive lead I_ (usually negative), and negative _lead II_ and _lead III_

- Typical diagnosis:
    * Absent p-waves with irregular rhythm: Afib
    * ST elevation >1mm (1 small square), in 2+ contiguous limb leads, or >2mm in 2+ chest leads: MI (full thickness)
    * WPW Syndrome typically presents with a mild sinus tachycardia with a broad QRS complex and delta wave on ECG.
