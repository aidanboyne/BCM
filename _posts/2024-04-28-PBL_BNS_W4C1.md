## Multiple Sclerosis

Most information taken from [_**Filippi et al.**_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-018-0041-4)

The clinical manifestations and course of MS are heterogeneous; in most patients, reversible episodes of neurological deficits (known as relapses) that usually last for days or weeks characterize the initial phases of the disease (that is, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS)). Over time, the development of permanent neurological deficits and the progression of clinical disability become prominent (known as secondary progressive MS (SPMS). A minority of patients have progressive disease from onset - known as primary progressive MS (PPMS).


### Epidemiology & Risk Factors
- Onset: Generally 20-35 (RRMS), 40y.o. (PPMS)
- Gender: Female predominant (3:1)
- Ethnicity: Primarily European
- Environmental risk (OR): 
    - Smoking (1.6)
    - Seropositive EBV (3.6)
    - Low vitamin D (1.4)
    - Adolescent Obesity (2.0)
    - Other factors include night work, low sun, mono, passive smoking, exposure to organic solvents. Protective factors include alcohol, coffee, oral nicotine, although the level of evidence is low.
- Genetic Factors: HLA class I and II gene polymorphisms (especially HLA-DRB1*1501) convey the largest degree of heritable risk, though there are a wide range of contributing mutations [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28987266/).

### Pathophysiology

MS is characterized by focal plaque formation due to demyelination of nerves typically located around post-capillary venules. There is also a marked breakdown in the blood brain barrier (likley due to pro-inflammatory damage) which enhances CNS lesion development.

Lesions occur in both gray and white matter and cause symptoms primarily due to location rather than absolute size. 
- **White matter lesions**: Active lesions (most common in CIS/RRMS) have heavy CD8+ and CD20+ T and B cells, microglia, macrophages, and reactive astrocytes. Inactive lesions are hypocellular with well-defined demyelination and low axon density accompanied by astrocyte gliosis.
- **Gray matter lesions**: cortical demyelination in the forebrain and cerebellum begins in the early phase of disease and is most notable in PPMS and SPMS. These primarily occur in sulci and deep invaginations, though they may also occur in deep grey matter nuclei and spinal cord grey matter (where it is more prevalent than white matter demyelination). Grey matter lesions are subdivided into 4 categories:
    - Type I: cortico-subcortical border
    - Type II: small perivenous intracortical lesions not infiltrating the pia
    - Type III: lesions which extend inward from subpail layers
    - Type IV: lesions extending through the entire with of the cortex but not into white matter

Limited remyelination takes place, though full functional recovery is almost never acheived. 

The detailed mechanisms are detailed in the graphic below:

Primary takeaways theories include insufficient T-reg activity and excess Th17 cell activity which impacts the CNS due to breakdown of the BBB. B-cell involvment is thought to be cytokine rather than antibody mediated.

### Diagnosis

Presentation depends on location of inital lesiosn. Characteristic findings include:
-   Optic neuritis: acute painful monocular visual loss with RAPD
- Brainstem/cerebellar: diplopia, ataxia, vertigo, scanning speech, dysarthria, tremor, nystagmus/INO
- Pyramidal tract: weakness and spasticity
- Spinal cord: shock sensation on neck flexion, neurogenic bladder, paraparesis, sesnory deficits

General symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and cognitive decline are often present. Symptoms are usually wose with heat/exercise (Uhthoff phenomenon).

MRI will show characteristic hyperintense lesions on T2 (ependymal dot-dash sign). Other invesigations include oligoclonal bands and elevated MPB in CSF, elevated serum IgG.

Optimal imaging for core lesiona types include:
- Periventricular: T2-FLAIR
- Juxtacortical/Cortical: T2-FLAIR
- Infratentorial: T2-FLAIR
- Spinal: multiple saggital sequences including STIR, T2, PD, PSIR
- Optic nerve: 2D STIR

Gadolinum enhancement is used to depict early inflammotory phase [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7655403/)

STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery) images are highly water-sensitive and the timing of the pulse sequence used acts to suppress signal coming from fatty tissues – so ONLY WATER is bright [[ref]](https://www.radiologymasterclass.co.uk/tutorials/mri/mri_sequences)

MS is diagnosed using the McDonald Criteria:

#### Optic Neuritis (ON)

ON is diagnosed clinically by symptoms of acute unilateral decrease in vision, eye pain (especially with movement), RAPD (in unilateral or bilateral asymmetric cases), decreased color vision/contrast/brightness sense and a visual field defect. Less commonly, patients may present with absence of eye pain, absence of orbital discomfort, bilateral, marked vision loss, and severe optic disc swelling with hemorrhages or retinal exudates. These cases should be considered for further work up to determine if an underlying inflammatory or infectious process can be found.

An MRI depicting enhancement of the optic nerve after administration of gadolinium is helpful but not required to make the clinical diagnosis. The main indication of MRI is derived from its prognostic value for the presence of or future development of MS. MRI is far superior to computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of ON [[ref]](https://eyewiki.aao.org/Demyelinating_Optic_Neuritis).

### Therapy

#### Acute Therapy

For patients with an acute MS exacerbation (relapse, attack) that results in neurologic symptoms and increased disability or impairments in vision, strength, or cerebellar function, we recommend a short course of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (Grade 1B). The main goal of treatment is to speed recovery time from the MS attack. However, acute treatment has no apparent benefit for improving long-term disability or for reducing the risk of subsequent attacks. For patients with acute, severe neurologic deficits caused by MS who have a poor response to treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids, we suggest treatment with plasma exchange [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults).

#### Disease Modifying Agents
- Monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, ocrelizumab, rituximab, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, and ublituximab):
   - Bind to specific targets on immune cells, preventing their migration into the central nervous system (CNS) or depleting/modulating them, thereby reducing inflammation and neuronal damage.
- Oral agents (fumarates, S1PR modulators, pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors, and cladribine):
   - Fumarates: Activate the Nrf2 pathway, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.
   - S1PR modulators: Sequester lymphocytes in lymph nodes, reducing their migration into the CNS.
   - Pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors: Inhibit de novo pyrimidine synthesis, suppressing lymphocyte proliferation.
   - Cladribine: Cytotoxic agent that preferentially depletes lymphocytes.
- IFNB (interferon beta):
   - Modulates immune responses, reducing inflammation and promoting neuroprotection through various mechanisms, including downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
- Glatiramer acetate:
   - Synthetic polymer that mimics myelin basic protein, inducing tolerance and modulating the immune response, leading to reduced inflammation and neuronal damage.
- Other immunomodulatory agents such as AZA, cyclophosphamide, glucocorticoids, and mitoxanone are used but have mixed evidence or unnaccepatbe side effect profiles.

### Prognosis

MS symptoms cause death directly in >50% of patients, and MS patients are at substantially higher risk of secondary infection and suicide. The net reduction in life expected is approximatley 10 years.

Characteristics of the disease at onset are often predictive of disease progression. The details can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-018-0041-4/tables/3).

## Case Specific Points

### Steroid-induced psychosis

For steroid-induced psychosis to be diagnosed, a number of criteria must be met. First, the patient must have at least delusions or hallucinations after exposure to a medication capable of producing these symptoms. The disturbance cannot be better explained by a non–medication-induced psychotic disorder, and it does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. Finally, it must cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment. These requirements make the condition a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore a physician must rule out other potential differential diagnoses of other medications, drug use, intoxication, electrolyte imbalance, infection, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, neoplasms, or known psychiatric causes [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6793974/).

The pathophysiology of this disorder is poorly understood but basically follows that of other diseases like Cushing’s or Addison’s in that abnormalities of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis have the potential to result in mood disorders by disturbing the cortisol pathway as the synthetic steroids activate glucocorticoid receptors preferentially, which suppresses the secretion of cortisol by the adrenal glands. This preferential selection creates imbalance between glucocorticoid stimulation over mineralocorticoid receptor stimulation, leading to cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances

### Pharmacology
- **Risperidone**: D2 dopaminergic receptor and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptor inhibitor. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic (positive symptoms) pathways and mesocortical (negative symptoms) pathways, respectively [[ref]](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00734).
- **Ocrelizumab**: Ocrelizumab is a second-generation anti-CD20 recombinant monoclonal antibody with a molecular mass of 145kDa. It is a follow-up to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab but with a humanized IgG1 tail [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547750/).
