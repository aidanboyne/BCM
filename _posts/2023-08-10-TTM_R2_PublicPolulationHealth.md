## Health system science
 _How healthcare is delivered and how providers collaborate to improve patient care. Population helath is one piece of this puzzle._

Clinical care (quality and access) is only a factor in health outcomes. 

### Public healthcare
_Public health consists of quarantines, sanitary conditions (pioneered in 1854 by John Snow in response to cholera), disease surveillance, maternal/child health, and more recently, emphasis on non-communicable disease (including prevention via environment and healthy behavior).

Public health is primarily carried out by government agencies at the federal and primarily state/local levels. It is defined by
 – Emphasis on geographic communities 
 – Typically considered a governmental responsibility 
 – Excludes individual health care delivery

### Population health
_The health outcomes of a group of individuals and the distribution within the groups. Engaged parties and responsibilities include:_
 - Physicians: patient panels
 - Health systems: accountable care orgs
 - Employers: employees
 - Community organizations: specific conditions and those with housing/transport/food... needs
 
Population health consists of  
 – Using data to examine outcomes within specific groups 
 – Expansive stakeholders (such as employers, hospital systems, insurers) 
 – Health care delivery (preventive and illness)
 – Data used to create targeted interventions for specific population subgroups
 
Health disparities are differences in health outcomes between groups of people. Structural determinants of health inequities include:
 - Socioeconomic Status
 - Gender
 - Race/ethnicity
 - Eductation

Addressing these SoDoH requires both individual interventions and health systems changes. When considering policy interventions, remember the 5 P's: **Patients, Providers, Payers, Public entities, Press**.


#### Steps for intervention and example:
1. ID target population - BCM students
2. ID specific SoDoH they may be facing - Food insecurity
3. Barriers to excellent outcomes - Money and time
4. Subgroup equity - Low income students and students spending a lot of time on campus
5. ID potential intervention - Setup foodbank for students near campus
6. ID lived experience experts - Ask those who have been food insecure, don't build only from top down
7. What data needs for problem scale/solution efficacy - Pre and post solution student food insecurity

Population health is especially important in value based care (value = quality/cost). Insurance companies are demanding good health outcomes over time. This contrasts with historical per-visit compensation metrics.
