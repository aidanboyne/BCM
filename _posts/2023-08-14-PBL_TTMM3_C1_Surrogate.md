## Pathophysiology

### Osteoarthritis

#### Intro

Primary OA is the most common subset of the disease and is diagnosed in the absence of a predisposing trauma or disease but is associated with risk factors such as female gender, obesity, anatomical factors, muscle weakness, and joint injury (occupation/sports activities).

Secondary OA occurs with a preexisting joint abnormality. Predisposing conditions include trauma or injury, congenital joint disorders, inflammatory arthritis, avascular necrosis, infectious arthritis, Paget disease, osteopetrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease), hemoglobinopathy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Marfan syndrome.

OA causes moderate to severe disability in approximatley 43 million people worldwide

OA is defined by articular cartilage that develops surface fibrillation, irregularity, and focal erosions. These erosions eventually extend down to the bone and continually expand to involve more of the joint surface. On a microscopic level, after cartilage injury, the collagen matrix is damaged, causing chondrocytes to proliferate and form clusters. A phenotypic change to hypertrophic chondrocyte occurs, causing cartilage outgrowths that ossify and form osteophytes. As more of the collagen matrix is damaged, chondrocytes undergo apoptosis. Improperly mineralized collagen causes subchondral bone thickening; in advanced disease, bone cysts infrequently occur. 

#### Clinical presentation [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482326/)

General stiffness, pain, and ROM restriction in affected areas related to activity that resolves with rest. Swelling, deformity, and weakness in surrounding muscles occurs with disease progression. OA most commonly affects proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, fist carpometacarpal joints, hips, knees, first metatarsophalangeal joints, and joints of lower cervical/lumbar spine.

In H&P, look for
1. pain worse with activity and better with rest
2. age more than 45 years
3. morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes
4. bony joint enlargement
5. limitation in range of motion. 

A differential diagnosis should include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, crystalline arthritis, hemochromatosis, bursitis, avascular necrosis, tendinitis, radiculopathy, among other soft tissue abnormalities. Blood test for WBC can rule out RA. Note radiological findings such as joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis do not correlate with severity of disease. Worsening of OA over time can be measured by ultrasound using ACS (articular cartilage score).

#### Treatment

Non-pharmacologic therapy includes:
1. avoidance of activities exacerbating pain or overloading the joint
2. exercise to improve strength
3. weight loss
4. occupational therapy for unloading joints via brace, splint, cane, or crutch

Pharmacologic therapy typically starts with oral Acetaminophen and/or oral/topical NSAIDs PRN. Interarticular joint injections including glucocorticoids, hyaluronic acids, or platelet rich plasma are another option. Surgical replacement of knee or hip is a option for patients failing above therapies.

### Dementia

#### Intro
Dementia is characterized by an overall decline in memory and other cognitive skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. It is characterized by the progressive and persistent deterioration of cognitive function. Affected patients often have memory loss and a partial or significant lack of insight into their deficits. It is most commonly caused by Alzheimer's Disease (70-80%), but can also result from vascular disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, Parkinson's, HIV, Huntington, TBI, prion diseases, or unknown causes.

![Dementia Criteria](/img/Dimentia_criteria.png)

#### Pathophysiology

- Alzheimer's: widespread atrophy of the cortex and deposition of amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons which contribute to their degeneration
- Parkinson's and Lewy body:  intracellular accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are insoluble aggregates of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain
- Frontotemporal: various mutations leading to the deposition of ubiquitinated TDP-43 and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes resulting in dementia, early personality, behavioral changes, and aphasia depending on the subtype
- Vascular: ischemic injury (e.g. stroke) leading to permanent neuronal death

HIV causes toxic inflammation, prions cause self spreading protein misfolding, and Huntington is a autosomal dominant mutation causing late onset cognitive impairment and tendency to insanity and suicide.

#### Management

No known cure, but exercise along with social and cognitive activity are thought to slow progression. Medication such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists have shown some benefit in slowing cognitive decline. Rivastigmine is approved for Parkinson disease subtype.

## Pharmacology

### Acetaminophen [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482369/)

Analgesic and antipyretic agent. Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway in CNS, but not in peripheral tissues. Inhibition of the COX pathway - via some mechanism _not_  involving active site binding to either COX-1 or COX-2 - inhibits synthesis of prostaglandin and other eicosanoids.

Rash may occur, and prolonged or large doses can cause nephrotoxicity, hematological and metabolic issues, and liver failure. Overdose can be neutralized via N-acetylcystine administration in the first 8 hours following overdose.

### NSAIDs

Analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Include nonselective (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen Sodium) and COX-2 selective (Celeoxib) COX inhibitors. Inhibition of the COX pathway via COX-1 and COX-2 inhibits synthesis of prostaglandin and other eicosanoids.

Nonselective inhibitors has well documented gastric adverse effects (GI bleeding, ulcers) due to COX-1 inhibition leading to decreased gastric mucosa integrity. Can also cause renal issues and platelet inhibition. 


### Corticosteroid Injections

Corticosteroids have both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect, but their mechanism of action is complex. Corticosteroids act directly on nuclear steroid receptors and interrupt the inflammatory and immune cascade at several levels. By this means, they reduce vascular permeability and inhibit accumulation of inflammatory cells, phagocytosis, production of neutrophil superoxide, metalloprotease, and metalloprotease activator, and prevent the synthesis and secretion of several inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin and leukotrienes. The clinical anti-inflammatory reflections of these actions are decreases in erythema, swelling, heat, and tenderness of the inflamed joints and an increase in relative viscosity with an increase in hyaluronic acid (HA) concentration.

Analgesic effect is short lived (up to 26 weeks in some studies). Additionally, long-term corticosteroid injections have been linked to osteoporosis.

### Informed Consent

Informed consent requires
1. Disclosure: discuss the patient's diagnosis, the proposed treatment and its risks and benefits, and any medically reasonable alternatives
    - Disclose according to reasonable physician, patient, and subjective standards
2. Understanding
3. Voluntariness: Persuasion and negotiation to try to encourage the patient to accept a treatment that is medically beneficial likely does not undermine voluntariness, but coercion (threats to control patient behavior) and manipulation (misrepresenting or confusing patients) prevents patients from making a voluntary decision. Further discussion of persuasion can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866725/)
4. Choice: verbal agreement may be sufficient. For major interventions, however, written authorization should be obtained

**Best practices to improve patient decisions**
![Patient Decision Helper](/img/patient_decisions.png)

_Swindell et al._

Using anecdotal evidence during persuasion can be very effective, but has its own set of considerations [[ref]](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(19)48171-4/pdf). In fact, anecdotal recommendations are often more effective than evidence based persuasion. 

### Shared Decision Making
 - Seek patient participation
 - Help your patient explore and compare treatment options
 - Assess your patient's values and preferences
 - Reach a decision with your patient
 - Evaluate your patient's decision

### Ageism in Medicine [[ref]](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/curren1/chapter/7-2-identifying-age-bias-in-medicine/)

Common beliefs include the ideas that older adults are unable to adapt to change or learn new information, that they are often bored, irritable or angry, or that they become more religious with age. Healthcare providers often assume that older people are not sexually active, or are not interested in sexual activity, however, half to two-thirds of older adults are sexually active. As such, older patients may not be appropriately counseled about or screened for sexually transmitted infections due to erroneous provider assumptions about their sexual activity. Hearing loss is also commonly associated with aging by healthcare personnel, and is often assumed rather than checked.

### Surrogates in Medical Decision Making

A **Medical Power of Attorney** (MPOA) is a type of "advance directive" that provides a simple way to name someone you trust (an agent) to speak to your health care providers and make health care decisions for you (the principal) when you cannot make decisions for yourself.

Any competent adult can be your agent, except:
 - Your physician or health care provider
 - An employee of your physician or health care provider (unless the employee is your relative)
 - Your residential health care provider (nursing home, for example)
 - An employee of your residential health care provider (unless the employee is your relative)

The agent can then make most medical decisions for you in the case that a physician determines you no longer have the capacity to do so. They have the final say for medical and surgical treatments, life-prolonging interventions, organ donation, deciding where medical treatment will be received, psychiatric treatment, and release of medical records/communicating results with loved ones unless otherwise noted in an advance directive.

The agent cannot make the following decisions (in Texas):
 - Agree to hospitalize you for mental health services
 - Agree to convulsive treatment or psychosurgery
 - Agree to an abortion
 - Refuse care that will keep you comfortable

#### Best practice for physicians [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2219771/)

Surrogates identified the following factors that made decision making more or less difficult:
1. Characteristics and life circumstances (such as coping strategies and competing responsibilities)
2. Social networks (such as intrafamily discord about the “right” decision)
3. Surrogate–patient relationships and communication (such as difficulties with honoring known preferences)
4. Surrogate–clinician communication and relationship (such as interacting with a single physician whom the surrogate recognizes as the clinical spokesperson vs. many clinicians)

Physicians can take the following steps to help surrogates deal with their responsibility:
1. Prior to decision-making, include future surrogate decision-makers in ACP discussions they have with their patients
2. During decision-making, define the surrogate role as helping clinicians to understand what outcomes of treatment align best with the patient’s goals. Rather than ask surrogates to assume the responsibility for treatment decisions, clinicians can clarify that the desired role for the surrogate’s participation is to represent the patient’s values and preferences, as well as the surrogates’ own needs and preferences when appropriate. Clinicians can then make treatment recommendations based on their knowledge of the patient.
3. Identify and address surrogate stressors during decision-making - ask surrogates to identify the most difficult aspects of the decision and refer them to social workers and chaplains if appropriate to discuss these issues in more depth.
4. Offering reassurance that surrogates made a good decision for a loved one may help bring closure to the process


When talking to a patient with dementia, the following can help (depending on the dementia progression):
 - speak clearly and slowly, using short sentences
 - make eye contact with the person when they're talking or asking questions
 - give them time to respond, because they may feel pressured if you try to speed up their answers
 - encourage them to join in conversations with others, where possible
 - let them speak for themselves during discussions about their welfare or health issues
 - acknowledge what they have said, even if they do not answer your question, or what they say seems out of context – show that you've heard them and encourage them to say more about their answer
 - give them simple choices – avoid creating complicated choices or options for them
    - pictographic pain charts or the abbey pain scale (see below), for example, give an easy to understand list of options
 - use other ways to communicate – such as rephrasing questions because they cannot answer in the way they used to

Turn to the surrogate if the patient is unable to satisfactorily answer your question or if they explicitly defer the question to their guardian/surrogate

### Guardianship

In Texas, guardianship is a legal relationship established by a court of law that appoints a guardian to care for someone who is incapacitated and unable to care for themselves (the ward).

Texas law defines an “incapacitated person” as:
 - A minor
 - An adult individual, such as an elderly person or developmentally disabled adult, who, because of a physical or mental condition, is substantially unable to provide for themselves, to care for their own physical health, or manage their financial affairs; or
 - An individual who must have a guardian appointed to receive funds due them from any governmental source.

There are four different types of guardianships available in Texas:
 - Guardian of the person, full or limited: The guardian is responsible for providing care, supervision, food, clothing, medical treatment, and shelter for their ward.
 - Guardian of the estate, full or limited: The guardian is responsible for managing the property and financial affairs of their ward.
 - Guardian of the person and estate: The guardian is responsible for managing the care AND property of their ward.
 - Temporary/emergency guardianship: A temporary guardianship is appointed until the court makes its decision.

### Physician Assistants

Physician assistants are health care professionals licensed to practice medicine with physician supervision. PAs conduct physical exams, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret tests, counsel on preventive health care, assist in surgery, and write prescriptions. A PA’s practice may also include education, research, and administrative services.

In 2017, a Pennsylvania court decision (Shinal v. Toms) established legal precendent that PAs _cannot_ obtain informed consent, only physicians.
