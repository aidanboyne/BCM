Background
* What is the normal body process of calcium storage, metabolism, and excretion?
* Relationship of phosphate to calcium 
* Vitamin D
* What is the normal function of the parathyroid?
* Differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia (differentiate each by relevant laboratory indices) 
* Hyperparathyroidism
* Drug-induced
* Thiazide (include MOA and contraindications)
* Sarcoidosis (prevalence based on race and age) 
* Malignancy-related causes 
* How do you manage hypercalcemia in emergent situations?

Hyperparathyroidism
* Pathophysiology 
* Etiologies 
* Genetic Factors
* Primary vs Secondary
* Clinical Presentation
* Symptoms: anxiety, constipation, bone pain “inside legs” during exercise, “peeing sand”, unintentional weight loss (20 lbs in case) 
* Lab Findings 
* CBC 
* BMP 
* Serum Calcium
* Serum Phosphate 
* Albumin (What is the index requiring adjustment of observed calcium level of 12 mg/dL?) 
* Serum PTH 
* Serum Vit D
* Genetic Testing (function, pathway, additional consequences)
* MEN1
* c-RET
* Imaging 
* CT of Chest and Abdomen
* US of Neck: Hypervascular region near L lower border of thyroid gland 
* Scintigraphy 
* Treatments (MOA and CI if relevant) 
* IV Zoledronate 
Surgery to remove overactive gland
