See previous article on [**osteoperosis**](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/posts/PBL_IMIS_W3C1/#calcium-regulation-ref).

## Differential for Hypercalcemia [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-hypercalcemia)

- **Parathyroid mediated**
    - **Primary hyperparathyroidism (sporadic)**: see below
    - **Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome**: rare genetic disorder characterized by parathyroid tumors and ossifying jaw tumors.
    - **Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia**: An inherited condition causing high blood calcium levels with low urinary calcium excretion.
    - **Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (kidney failure)**
- **Non-parathyroid mediated**
    - **Hypercalcemia of malignancy**: Elevated calcium levels due to cancer-related factors.
    - **Secretion of PTHrP**:Production of parathyroid hormone-related protein by certain tumors.
    - **Increased calcitriol (activation of extrarenal 1-alpha-hydroxylase)**: Elevated levels of active vitamin D due to abnormal activation outside the kidneys.
    - **Osteolytic bone metastases and local cytokines**: Destruction of bone tissue by cancer cells and associated signaling molecules.
    - **Vitamin D intoxication**: Toxic levels of vitamin D in the body, often due to excessive supplementation.
    - **Chronic granulomatous disorders or other illnesses characterized by granuloma formation**: Diseases causing the formation of granulomas, which can affect calcium metabolism.
- **Medications**

## Secondary Hyperparathyroidism

* **Decreased intestinal calcium absorbtion**: Vitamin D <20ng/mL, Bariatric surgery, malabsorbtion, low intake
* **Renal Insufficiency**: eGFR <60 ml/min, hypercalciuria, or loop diuretics
* **Hungry Bone Syndrome**: Post parathyroidectomy for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, the remaining parathyroid glands can overcompensate to accrue skeletal calcium to rebuild damaged bone
* **Pseudohypoparathyroidism**: Genetic PTH resistance leads to high levels of PTH in an attempt to resorb calcium
* **Drugs**: Lithium, hydrochlorothiazides, anticonvolsants (esp. with low vitamin D), bisphosphonates, denosumab.

* Drug-induced
* Thiazide (include MOA and contraindications)
* Sarcoidosis (prevalence based on race and age) 
* Malignancy-related causes

## Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201633)

Excessive PTH from one or more of the 4 parathyroid glands. It is typically associated with hypercalcemia. Symptomatic presentation includes fragility fractures and kidney stones, though increased screening has resulted in a rise in asymptomatic presentation. 

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology

Highest incidence in black and white individuals. Lower in Asian and hispanic individulas. More common in women. 

![Patho](/img/PTHup_patho.webp)

PTH secretion is downregulated by high levels of Calcium (via CASR binding) and 1,25(OH)D. In hyperplasia, increased number of cells maintain normal sensitivity but secrete more due to higher functional mass. Adenomas show lower sensitivity to inhibition by calcium, causing increased PTH regardless of hypercalcemic status. 

High phosphate levels indirectly stimulate PTH sythesis and secretion by binding calcium and lowering available calcium for CASR binding. FGF23 released from osteocytes is also though to inhibit PTH. Hyperparathyroidism causes an increased calcium set point due to relative insensitivity to hypercalcemic conditions. 

PHPT is sypically caused by a sporadic (usually via cyclin-D1 overexpression and sporadic MEN1 gene mutation), solidtary, benign adenoma. Multiglandular adenomas and parathyroid carcinoma only account for 5-10% and <1 % of PHPT respectivley. Syndromic PHPT is associated with MEN1 (MEN1), MEN2A (RET), and MEN4 (CDKN1B). Multiglandular PHPT is especially associated with MEN1. There are also several genetic abnormalities associated with non-syndromic PHPT. 

### Presentation

Highly active disease is characterized by bone pain, skeletal deformity, and fractures. Osteolytic lesions can often be seen in the jaw and vertebrae when PHPT is associated with osteitis fibrosis cystica. General symptoms — in particular, fatigue, weakness, anxiety and mood alterations — along with impairment in quality of life (QOL) may or may not improve after surgical cure

### Workup

* **Labs**: BUN and creatinine should be measured to determine if impaired renal function is related to hypercalcemia. Serum corrected calcium, PTH, phosphate, and Vit. D levels are indicated. Urine calcium (for stone risk) and creatinine for kidney function. Genetic testing if MEN1/2A are suspected and serum C-peptide, ALP for bone reabsorbtion.
    - The total calcium level can be corrected for low albumin levels by adding 0.8 mg per dL (0.20 mmol per L) to the total serum calcium level for every 1.0 g per dL (10 g per L) by which the serum albumin concentration is lower than 4 g per dL (40 g per L).
* **Symptoms**: PHPT is now often detected in the asymptomatic stage. However, prolonged or sever hypercalcemia can result in overt bone disease, kidney stones, and nonspecific gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neuromuscular dysfunction. [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2004/0115/p333.html)
* **Imaging**: The primary goal of imaging in a clinically diagnosed case of hyperparathyroidism is precise localisation of the presence of parathyroid lesions which permits accurate surgical planning. The first line imaging modalities are ultrasound of the neck and scintigraphy. The inability to localise on these modalities or disconcordant findings on these modalities necessitates the use of 4D CT, MRI or F-Choline PET [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10080580/)

    _Right superior parathyroid adenoma_. A 50-year-old female with raised parathormone levels (96 IU) was examined using duplex ultrasound for parathyroid glands. A: Grey scale sonography in the transverse and longitudinal plane showed a well circumscribed lesion posterior to the right lobe of thyroid gland and separated from it by a clear fat plane; B: Colour doppler image shows a feeding vessel. Corroborative magnetic resonance imaging axial images show a subcentimetric lesion (arrows) posterior to the middle third of the right lobe of thyroid gland which is C: T1 hypointense; D: T2 hyperintense; E: Coronal T2w image better demonstrates the lesion; F: Correlative single photon emission computed tomography component of MIBI scan showing tracer avid lesion at the superior pole of the right lobe of thyroid; G: Image of the resected adenoma weighing 1.05 g.

### Treatment

Surgery is reccomended for all symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients meeting any of the following criteria:
* Age <50 years
* Serum calcium concentration of ≥1 mg per dl above the upper normal limit
* T-score at or below –2.5 at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip or distal one-third of the radius, or the presence of vertebral fracture by X-ray or vertebral fracture assessment
* Creatinine clearance of <60 ml per minute, increased risk of kidney stones by biochemical stone risk analysis, and kidney stones or nephrocalcinosis by abdominal imaging

Nonsurgical management includes monitoring, adequate hydration, repletion of vitamin D if needed, and cinacalcet in patients who meet surgical criteria but have medical contraindications to surgery or prior failed parathyroidectomy. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronate may improve BMD in patients with PHPT. 

## Miscellaneous

* **Anchoring Bias**: Anchoring bias is closely related to confirmation bias and comes into play when interpreting evidence. It refers to physicians’ practices of prioritizing information and data that support their initial impressions, even when first impressions are wrong. It often manifests when the first piece of information given to a physician is relied upon too heavily when making decisions. [[ref]](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/believing-overcoming-cognitive-biases/2020-09) To overcome this bias, 3 things are necessary
    1) physicians must fully appreciate the contribution of cognitive biases to errors in medical decision making
    2) they must recognize that such errors are not inevitable
    3) they must be optimistic that solutions to reduce bias work.

    Guided reflection and cognitive forcing are two strategies that have seen some success in practice.
* **Zoledronate**: An integral step in new bone formation is the avid binding of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to hydroxyapatite crystals found in bone. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate are PPi analogs with a higher binding affinity. These bisphosphonates, therefore, preferentially bind to bone, especially at sites that are being actively remodeled. The bone-bound bisphosphonates are released during the process of bone breakdown by osteoclasts.

    Once released, the bisphosphonate is then absorbed by osteoclasts. Within the osteoclasts, the bisphosphonate binds to and blocks the activity of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS). FPPS is an essential intracellular enzyme in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase pathway responsible for producing isoprenoid lipids, cholesterol, and other sterols. Inhibition of this pathway prevents the posttranslational modification of small proteins, including guanosine triphosphate binding proteins, which are needed for the activity and survival of osteoclasts.

    Therefore, the administration of zoledronate increases osteoclast apoptosis, thus reducing bone resorption and loss. Osteoblastic activity and bone formation are not impacted by the use of zoledronate. Hence the use of this agent shifts bone metabolic activity in favor of bone formation, reducing bone loss.
