### Adverse Events
 - **Preventable**:  those that occurred due to error or failure to apply an
accepted strategy for prevention.
 - **Ameliorable**:  events that, while not preventable, could have been less
harmful if care had been different
 - **Due to Negligence**:  occurred due to care that falls below the
standards expected of clinicians
 - **Near Miss**:  unsafe situation that is indistinguishable from a preventable adverse
event except for the outcome. A patient is exposed to a hazardous situation, but does
not experience harm either through luck or early detection.
 - **Error**: broader term referring to any act of commission (doing something wrong) or
omission (failing to do the right thing) that exposes patients to a potentially hazardous
situation.
    - No fault error: Masked or unusual disease presentation, uncooperative patient
    - System related error: technical or organizational flaws
    - Cognitive errors: Faulty knowledge, data gathering/synthesis


Error prevention and recognition should occur at level of
 - the individual physician
 - the team
 - systems-based approaches


Rule of thumb - look at the behavior, not the outcome. Following procedure in system of care provides safety net to catch rare mess-ups.
