# Cell signaling
**Objective**: Describe the four most common types of cell signaling and their role in the regulation of homeostasis in terms of positive and negative feedback.

### Four ways of cell signaling
1. **Ion Channel-linked**: Fast on/off response, typically in milliseconds. Examples include Nicotine and GABA.
2. **G Protein-linked**: Slower than ion channels but with a response time of seconds. Examples include Epinephrine and Albuterol.
3. **Enzyme-linked**: Slower response time, ranging from minutes to hours. Examples are insulin and growth factors.
4. **DNA-linked**: Alters gene expression. This is the slowest form, taking hours to weeks. Examples include Cortisol and Prednisone.

#### How Molecules Cross Membranes
- **Small hydrophobic molecules**: Examples include \(O_2\), \(CO_2\), NO, and steroid hormones.
- **Small to large hydrophilic molecules**: \(H_2O\) is permeable, whereas glucose & urea are not permeable.
- **Highly charged polar molecules**: Examples are ions like Na, K, Cl, Ca, and Mg. These need ion channels to cross the cell membrane.

### Channel Behavior
- Most channels are in the **CLOSED** state; there are many ways to open channels. Some potassium channels (referred to as leak channels) are mostly in the open state and are responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential.
- The terms **‘signal’** and **‘ligand’** are used interchangeably.

## Membrane Potential
- **Resting membrane potential**: Negative inside cells, usually between -60 to -70 millivolts. This is mainly due to the movement of \(K^+\) ions through \(K^+\) leak channels which are always open.
- **Threshold potential**: Typically between -45 to -55 millivolts. This is the voltage at which all voltage-gated \(Na^+\) channels (or \(Ca^{2+}\) channels) open, resulting in membrane depolarization.
- **Depolarization/Repolarization/Hyperpolarization**: Different effects on the cell membrane due to the opening of various channels.
- **EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential)**: The membrane potential moves closer to the threshold.
- **IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential)**: The membrane potential moves farther from the threshold.

### Signal Levels in Blood
Levels of various signals in the blood increase under different conditions, with a change ranging from 5 to 50-fold being considered normal. Examples include:
- **Fed state**: Elevated insulin levels.
- **Hungry state**: Elevated glucagon levels.
- **Stress**: Elevated cortisol levels.
- **Emergency**: Elevated epinephrine levels.

### Insulin and Metabolism
- **Insulin** regulates the metabolism of major nutrients, including the transport of glucose, amino acids, and potassium into cells. 
- **Insulin binding** to a surface receptor initiates a series of phosphorylation reactions, leading to the recruitment of more glucose transporters. All these steps in the signaling cascade are potential targets for drugs.
- **Insulin mechanism**: It works through enzyme-linked receptor signaling. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (often termed insulin resistance) is due to defects in this signaling system.

# 1.4

1. **Epinephrine (Adrenaline): hormone**
    - Produced by: Adrenal medulla
    - Actions: Activates both α and β adrenergic receptors. It increases heart rate, force of contraction, and cardiac output (β1 effects), induces bronchodilation (β2 effects), and also has vasoconstrictive effects especially at high doses (α effects) due to preferential binding to β receptor being overwhelmed with greater α number on blood vessels.
    - Uses: Anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, croup, local hemostasis (when combined with local anesthetics).

2. **Isoproterenol**
    - Produced synthetically.
    - Actions: It's a non-selective β-adrenergic agonist. Increases heart rate and force of contraction (β1 effects) and causes bronchodilation (β2 effects).
    - Uses: Was once used for asthma and bradycardia, but there are safer alternatives now. Rarely used in modern medicine due to the potential for causing arrhythmias.

3. **Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline): Neurotransmitter**
    - Produced by: Locus coeruleus in the brain and postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings.
    - Actions: Primarily α-adrenergic receptor agonist with some β1 effects. Causes vasoconstriction, increasing systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.
    - Uses: Septic shock and other forms of shock to raise blood pressure.

4. **Dopamine**
    - Produced by: Several areas of the brain, including the substantia nigra.
    - Actions: At low doses, it stimulates dopamine receptors causing vasodilation in renal and splanchnic circulation. At moderate doses, it stimulates β1 receptors increasing heart contractility and output. At high doses, it has α effects causing vasoconstriction.
    - Uses: Shock, especially when renal perfusion needs support, and heart failure.

5. **Dobutamine**
    - Produced synthetically.
    - Actions: Primarily a β1-adrenergic agonist. Increases the force of heart muscle contraction and, to a lesser degree, heart rate, leading to increased cardiac output.
    - Uses: Heart failure (especially in acute decompensated cases), cardiac stress testing.

6. **Phenylephrine**
    - Produced synthetically.
    - Actions: Selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist. Causes vasoconstriction.
    - Uses: Nasal congestion (as a nasal spray), raising blood pressure (intravenous), pupil dilation during ophthalmic procedures, and as a spinal anesthetic adjunct.

# Week 1 Wednesday Notes

### Pearls
 - Humans cannot make unsaturated Fatty Acids
 - Lysosomes recycle cellular contents (i.e. glycogen)
 - Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) can occur due to translocation between c9-c22 leading to abnormal "Philadelphia" chromosome 22 that creates an unregulated kinase. This kinase (BCR-ABL) is blocked by imatinib (Gleevec), an oral drug.
 - ATP only **2** high energy bonds (beta/gamma, alpha/beta phosphate anhydride bonds). Last bond between ester and alpha phosphate is low energy ester bond.

#### Bond Types
1. Amino acids: peptide bond
2. Glucose polymer: glycosidic bond
3. glycerol+FA: ester bond
4. DNA sugars: phosphodiester bond

#### Some drugs
 - AZT: synthetic neucleotide mimicing thymidine with N3 replacing OH group
 - Cifloflaxin
   - inhibits bacterial gyrase (bacterial analouge of topoisomerase II)
   - In class of fluoroquinolones

### Replisome

The **replisome** is a complex molecular machinery responsible for **DNA replication** in cells. Its main components and functions include:

- **DNA Helicase**: This enzyme unwinds the double-stranded DNA, creating single strands to be used as templates.
- **Single-Strand Binding Proteins (SSBPs)**: These bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent them from re-annealing and protect them from degradation.
- **Primase**: Generates short RNA primers that provide a starting point for DNA synthesis.
- **DNA Polymerase**: An enzyme that extends the growing DNA chain by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand. There are different types for leading and lagging strand synthesis:
  - **Leading Strand**: Continuous synthesis in the direction of replication fork movement.
  - **Lagging Strand**: Discontinuous synthesis in the form of **Okazaki fragments**.
- **Topoisomerase**: Relieves tension in the DNA strand by cutting one (topoisomerase I - ATP independent) or both (topoisomerase II - ATP dependent) strands to allow DNA to unwind. Note 
- **DNA Ligase**: Connects the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand to produce a continuous DNA molecule.

ADD TYPES OF PLASIA


## Motivational Interviewing (MI)
 - Increase healthy behaviors: exercise, diet, medication adherence
 - Decrease unhealthy behaviours: substance abuse
 - Goal directed collaborative conversation to strengthen one's own motivation and get people to raise response
 - Increases retention and engagement, more effective than direct confrontation (5%), empowers without excusing
 - Feels good for physician: avoids abandonment and frustration
 - Useful anytime we need behavior change i.e. raise ambivalence, resolve ambivalence, increase confidence, and solidify new behavior

Change theory: 
 - Paradox of change: accept person for who they are and whay they do - allows them freedom to consider change rather than defending themselves
 - Michelangelo: People have personal expertise and wisdom and tend to develop positvley given proper conditions and support

Compassion
Curiosity
Change talk

Four principles:
1. Express Empathy
