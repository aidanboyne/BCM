# Cell signaling
**Objective**: Describe the four most common types of cell signaling and their role in the regulation of homeostasis in terms of positive and negative feedback.

### Four ways of cell signaling
1. **Ion Channel-linked**: Fast on/off response, typically in milliseconds. Examples include Nicotine and GABA.
2. **G Protein-linked**: Faster than ion channels but with a response time of seconds. Examples include Epinephrine and Albuterol.
3. **Enzyme-linked**: Slower response time, ranging from minutes to hours. Examples are insulin and growth factors.
4. **DNA-linked**: Alters gene expression. This is the slowest form, taking hours to weeks. Examples include Cortisol and Prednisone.

#### How Molecules Cross Membranes
- **Small hydrophobic molecules**: Examples include \(O_2\), \(CO_2\), NO, and steroid hormones.
- **Small to large hydrophilic molecules**: \(H_2O\) is permeable, whereas glucose & urea are not permeable.
- **Highly charged polar molecules**: Examples are ions like Na, K, Cl, Ca, and Mg. These need ion channels to cross the cell membrane.

### Channel Behavior
- Most channels are in the **CLOSED** state; there are many ways to open channels. Some potassium channels (referred to as leak channels) are mostly in the open state and are responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential.
- The terms **‘signal’** and **‘ligand’** are used interchangeably.

## Membrane Potential
- **Resting membrane potential**: Negative inside cells, usually between -60 to -70 millivolts. This is mainly due to the movement of \(K^+\) ions through \(K^+\) leak channels which are always open.
- **Threshold potential**: Typically between -45 to -55 millivolts. This is the voltage at which all voltage-gated \(Na^+\) channels (or \(Ca^{2+}\) channels) open, resulting in membrane depolarization.
- **Depolarization/Repolarization/Hyperpolarization**: Different effects on the cell membrane due to the opening of various channels.
- **EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential)**: The membrane potential moves closer to the threshold.
- **IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential)**: The membrane potential moves farther from the threshold.

### Signal Levels in Blood
Levels of various signals in the blood increase under different conditions, with a change ranging from 5 to 50-fold being considered normal. Examples include:
- **Fed state**: Elevated insulin levels.
- **Hungry state**: Elevated glucagon levels.
- **Stress**: Elevated cortisol levels.
- **Emergency**: Elevated epinephrine levels.

### Insulin and Metabolism
- **Insulin** regulates the metabolism of major nutrients, including the transport of glucose, amino acids, and potassium into cells. 
- **Insulin binding** to a surface receptor initiates a series of phosphorylation reactions, leading to the recruitment of more glucose transporters. All these steps in the signaling cascade are potential targets for drugs.
- **Insulin mechanism**: It works through enzyme-linked receptor signaling. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (often termed insulin resistance) is due to defects in this signaling system.
