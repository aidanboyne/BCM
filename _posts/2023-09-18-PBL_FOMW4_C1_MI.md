# Myocardial Infarction

## Pathogenesis

### Coronary Arteries

Two main arteries, right (RCA) and left main (LMCA) which originate from root of aorta and supply blood to myocardium. These arteries branch into several smaller arteries - the LMCA branches into the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) which supply the LA, LV, and anterior septal wall. Meanwhile, the RCA brnaches into the right posterior descending (PDA) and acute marginal which supply the RA, RV, and posterior septal wall. 
 - Note that the PDA typically originates form RCA (right dominance - 70%) but can arise from LCx (left dominance - 10%) or both RCA and LCx (codominance - 10%).

### Coronary Artery Disease

Atherosclerosis consists of two parts; atherosis (accumulation of fat accompanied by several macrophages) and sclerosis (fibrosis layer comprising smooth muscle cells, leukocyte, and connective tissue) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258672/). Atherosclerosis is formed in a series of 3 steps:

1. Fatty streak formation
    * Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) trapping
    * Activation of endothelial cells
    * Leukocytes activation
    * Formation of foam cells
2. Atheroma formation - SMC and endothelial cells secrete cytokines and growth factors causing smooth muscle proliferation, collagen deposition, and extracellular lipid accumulation in the blood vessel lumen (fibrofatty atheroma).
3. Plaque formation

Atherosclerosis of coronary arteries can cause progressive cardiac ischemia causing retrosternal chest pain that worsens over the case of a few minutes that may radiate to neck, jaw, or L arm. Stable CAD typically begins presenting symptoms around 70% occlusion of a coronary artery. Eventually, the sclerotic plaque can dislodge, causing thrombogenesis and occlusion of a coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction.

### Infarction [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537076)

Prolonged occlusion during an infarction can cause necrosis. This starts in the sub-endocardium (interior) and progresses towards the sub-epicardium (exterior) of the myocardial tissue. 

#### Common sites of MI
 - Left anterior descending (LAD): anterior wall and septum of LV
 - Right coronary artery (RCA): posterior wall, septum, and papillary muscles of LV
 - Left circumflex artery (LCX): lateral wall of LV 

Within 1 minute, ischemic damage occurs and contractility is lost. Within 20-40 minutes, damage is irreversible. Damage usually occurs most on the inner third of myocardium. If clot lyses (physiologically or due to intervention), they can have damage limited to this region - **Subendocardial infarct** or **NSTEMI** - which presents with ST segment depression (no elevation). Other causes of NSTEMI include severe atherosclerosis and hypotension. Within 3-6 hours, however, the entire myocardial wall is necrosed. This presents with ST elevation and is called a **transmural infarct** or **STEMI**.

### Epidemiology

Most common among men. White males, followed by black males, hispanics males and finally asian males have highest prevalence. Risk factors include: 
* Smoking
* Abnormal lipid profile/blood apolipoprotein (raised ApoB/ApoA1)
* Hypertension
* Diabetes mellitus
* Abdominal obesity (waist/hip ratio) (greater than 0.90 for males and greater than 0.85 for females)
* Psychosocial factors such as depression, loss of the locus of control, global stress, financial stress, and life events including marital separation, job loss, and family conflicts
* Lack of daily consumption of fruits or vegetables
* Lack of physical activity
* Alcohol consumption (weaker association, protective)

## Diagnosis

### Chest Pain Differentials

#### Cardiac
* Acute coronary syndrome – New onset chest pain, pain of a new character, or pain of prolonged duration not relieved by rest; ECG is usually abnormal:
* Unstable angina
* Myocardial infarction
    * NSTEMI – no ST elevation on ECG but with acute elevations of cardiac markers
    * STEMI – ST or T wave changes across a vascular region with acute elevations of cardiac markers
* Microvascular angina
* Pericarditis – Sharp pain, positional (improved with leaning forward), recent illness or myocardial infarction (or other risk factors), pericardial friction rub, diffuse ST elevations on ECG.
* Aortic dissection – Tearing chest pain that radiates to the back, hypotension, tachycardia, visible on CT.
* Coronary vasospasm
* Coronary artery dissection
* Stress-induced cardiomyopathy
* Heart failure
* Mitral valve disease (eg, prolapse, regurgitation, or stenosis)
* Substance related (eg, cocaine-related cardiomyopathy)
* Expanding aortic aneurysm – Positive risk factors (many are the same), visible on ultrasound or CT.

#### Pulmonary
* Pulmonary embolism – Pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, shortness of breath, syncope, evidence of right heart strain on ECG, CT angiogram.
* Pneumothorax
* Pneumonia – Pleuritic chest pain, cough, fever.
* Malignancy
* Pleuritis
* Sarcoidosis
* Acute chest syndrome
* Pulmonary hypertension

#### GI
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) – Burning pain, pain after eating large or spicy meals, pain on abdominal examination.
* Peptic ulcer disease – Look for positive risk factors.
* Esophageal spasm
* Esophagitis
* Eosinophilic esophagitis
* Hiatal hernia
* Esophageal rupture / perforation
* Referred pain from abdominal viscera (eg, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis) – Look for positive risk factors, liver function tests, pancreatic enzyme levels.
* Sickle cell crisis

#### Other
* Costochondritis – Sharp, localized, reproducible pain; history of traumatic injury.
* Rheumatic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia)
* Trauma
* Panic attack / generalized anxiety disorder – History of psychiatric disease with admissions.
* Herpes zoster (shingles) – Look for rash.

### Physical Presentation

- Chest pain, upper extremity pain, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort during exertion or at rest
    - Usually retrosternal and is sometimes described as the sensation of pressure or heaviness
    - Pain often radiates to the left shoulder, neck, or arms with no obvious precipitating factors
    - Typically pain lasts > 20 min and is unaffected by positional changes
- Dyspnea or fatigue
- Sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and syncope

**Note**: women and diabetic patients often present atypically without signature radiating chest pain/pressure.

#### Vitals
* The patient’s heart rate is often increased (tachycardic) secondary to a high sympathoadrenal discharge
* The pulse may be irregular because of ventricular ectopy, an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or other supraventricular arrhythmias; bradyarrhythmias may be present
* In general, the patient's blood pressure is initially elevated because of peripheral arterial vasoconstriction resulting from an adrenergic response to pain and ventricular dysfunction
    * With right ventricular MI or severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension and cardiogenic shock can be seen

### ECG

**ECG (Electrocardiogram)** records the **electrical activity** of the heart. It provides a graphic representation of the heart's electrical impulses as they travel through its tissues.

1. **Atrial Depolarization**: Initiated by the **SA (sinoatrial) node**, it results in the **P wave**.
   
2. **Ventricular Depolarization**: Begins at the **AV (atrioventricular) node** and travels through the **bundle of His** and **Purkinje fibers**, leading to the **QRS complex**. This corresponds to the contraction of the ventricles.

3. **Ventricular Repolarization**: Represents the relaxation of the ventricles and is observed as the **T wave**.

**Recording process**
- **Electrodes** are placed on the skin, capturing the sum of the electrical activity of the heart.
- The heart's electrical impulses cause a **difference in electrical potential** between electrodes. The ECG machine amplifies these differences and records them as **waveforms**.

![Electrodes](/img/electrode_placement.png)

**Conduction Abnormalities**:
- **Arrhythmias**: Irregular heart rhythms can be detected by abnormal spacing or appearance of ECG waveforms.
- **Heart Blocks**: Delays or interruptions in conduction, identified by prolonged intervals or missing waves. Example: A missing QRS after a P wave indicates **AV block**.
- **Ischemia or Infarction**: Damaged heart tissue alters the path and characteristics of electrical conduction. ECG changes, such as **ST-segment elevation** (as in a **STEMI**), can indicate a myocardial infarction.
- **Hypertrophy**: Enlarged heart chambers can alter the magnitude and direction of electrical vectors, changing waveform amplitudes.

#### Conduction

### Troponins

Troponin is a complex of three regulatory proteins (troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T) that are integral to muscle contraction in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but not smooth muscle. Measurements of cardiac-specific troponins I and T are extensively used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in the management of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome.

* Troponin C binds to calcium ions to produce a conformational change in TnI
* Troponin T binds to tropomyosin, interlocking them to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex
* Troponin I binds to actin in thin myofilaments to hold the actin-tropomyosin complex in place

![Troponin complex](/img/troponin_complex.png)

Diagnostic criteria for raised troponin indicating myocardial infarction is currently set by the WHO at a threshold of 2 μg or higher. Critical levels of other cardiac biomarkers are also relevant, such as creatine kinase. Troponin are typically elevated **4-9 hours** after MI and peak at **12-24** hours, though they can remain abnormally high for up to 2 weeks post event. For secondary MI, creatine kinase is more useful as it returns to normal level within 48 hours of initial MI. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5051615)

#### Other labs

* Potassium and magnesium levels need close monitoring in the setting of AMI (important in preventing Ca2+ influx and ROS generation mediated reperfusion injury)
* Creatinine level is also needed prior to initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.
* C-reactive protein (CRP) levels: Consider measuring CRP levels and other markers of inflammation upon presentation if an ACS is suspected.
* Lipid level profile

### Angiography

Contrast dye is injected into coronary artery (in percutaneous fluoroscopy angiography) or systemic circulation (CT angiography) and the coronary arteries and other heart vessels are visualized. Obstructions such as thromboses or plaques present as total or incomplete narrowing of the vessels.

## Treatment

### Time to Treat [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884185)

Restoring flow to the affected artery within 30 minutes can abort an infarction. If reperfusion occurs within 2–3 hours some preservation of myocardial function is achieved but after 6 hours there is little or no myocardial salvage. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that early presentation to the ED is associated with decreased mortality and decreased reinfarction rates for patients receiving thrombolytics.

However, as little as one-fifth of patients present to the hospital within one hour of symptom onset, while up to 40% delay more than 6 hours. In the Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment (REACT) trial, median time from symptom onset to arrival in the ED was 2.33 hours at baseline. Twenty-five percent of patients delayed longer than 5.2 hours.

#### Scar formation

Irreversible injury results in scar formation. Immediately after damage to the myocardium occurs, the damaged tissue becomes inflamed via accumulations of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes at the site of the trauma. Inflammatory cells upregulate the release of a myriad of signaling cytokines, growth factors, and hormones including TNF-α, IFN-γ, chemokines, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, endothelin, natriuretic peptides, and platelet-derived growth factors.

 Both the necrotic cells and the inflamed myocardium secrete and activate matrix metalloproteinase which aids in destruction and reabsorption of necrotic tissue. After several days, collagen accumulation at the site of injury begins to occur. As part of the extracellular matrix, granulated tissue consisting of fibrin, fibronectin, laminin, and glycosaminoglycan is suspended in the collagen base. The extracellular matrix acts as scaffolding for fibrillar collagen to form, the main constitute of scar tissue.

### Invasive Interventions

#### CABG

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or CABG (pronounced "cabbage"), is a procedure that uses your own veins (usually from the legs) or arteries (usually from the chest or arm) to bypass narrowed areas and restore blood flow to heart muscle. Thus, bypass surgery can markedly reduce or relieve chest pain for most people, and can prolong life for those with certain patterns of severe coronary heart disease.

* Internal thoracic arteries (also called internal mammary arteries) are under the left and right sides of the breast bone and are not fully removed from their original position- only the distal end is separated from the chest wall. This end is then attached to one of the coronary arteries. The left internal thoracic artery (also known as the left internal mammary artery or LIMA), which runs close to the most important coronary artery (the anterior descending coronary artery, or LAD), is generally the first choice for a graft.
    * Arterial grafts rarely develop stenosis (narrowing) and have an improved long-term patency compared with vein grafts. In addition, people with arterial grafts tend to have better survival, fewer reoperations, a lower rate of myocardial infarction, and less recurrent angina, as compared with vein grafts.
* Radial arteries are taken from the inner forearm. The long-term outcome with these arteries is also excellent and almost equivalent to that of the internal thoracic artery. There are usually only minimal changes in hand function after removal of the radial artery for CABG, which manifest as a small amount of forearm numbness and tingling.
* Saphenous veins are taken from the leg (calf or thigh). Narrowing (stenosis) of the vein graft due to changes that are similar to those of a coronary artery is a major problem with saphenous vein grafts. These narrowings develop in approximately 50 percent of people. Some narrowings occur as early as months after surgery, while others develop within five to seven years. 

#### Stenting and angioplasty

Percutaneous stenting is the process of placing a metal mesh in the coronary artery which holds it open and compresses the occluding plaque against vessel walls. Balloon angioplasty offers an alternative by only compressing the plaque via a wire-fed balloon, however it is not as effective in long term prevention and has higher MI reoccurrence rates.

Prasugrel has similar effects as clopidogrel in terms of all causes of death, MI, and stroke in ACS patients. For the patients who underwent PCI, prasugrel contributes to lower risk of stent thrombosis. However, prasugrel is associated with significantly higher risk of bleeding (approximatley 10x more potent platlet aggregation inhibitor).

#### Lifestyle Adjustments
It's important to manage risk factors (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes) by taking medications, quitting smoking, eating healthy food and getting active.


#### NNT and NNH [[ref]](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/assessment/research-methods-statistics/numbers-needed-treat-harm-nnt-nnh-statistics-tell)
* The number needed to treat (NNT) is a derived statistic that tells us how many patients must receive a particular treatment for 1 additional patient to experience a favorable outcome such as treatment response.
* The number needed to harm (NNH) is a derived statistic that tells us how many patients must receive a particular treatment for 1 additional patient to experience a particular adverse outcome.
* Lower NNT and higher NNH values are associated with a more favorable treatment profile.
