## Pathophysiology

Abdominal pain has a large number of potential causes which can be narrowed by finding the region(s) in which the pain primarily occurs.
![Abdominal Regions](/img/AbdominalRegions.jpg)

Focusing on the epigastric pain leads us to suspect gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastritis. Gastric ulcers are also possible and cause greater pain with meals that is not relieved by antiacids. Pancreatitis often presents with epigastric pain along with nausea and vomiting. However, in this case all of the above were ruled out in favor of anxiety related pain.

Anxiety can cause stomach pain due to the gut-brain axis (GBA) - the pathway between the central and enteric nervous system [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22314561/). The pain is amplified due to increased pain focus and perception due to the anxiety. Corticotrophin releasing factor in particular is expressed by CNS during anxiety and increases gut inflammation, permeability, motility, and visceral hypersensitivity via release of neurotransmitters and activation of mast cells with a corresponding pro-inflammatory immune response. Anxiety also changes microbiota composition

Pain in other regions can be due many causes, summarized below:

#### Anxiety

Anxiety itself is a relatively common disorder - around 19% of adults (majority women) in the U.S. are estimated to experience anxiety in a given year. It is characterized by excessive worry that is difficult to control accompanied by physical symptoms including restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance.

## Treatment and Pharmacology

#### Non-pharmacological
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first line treatment of anxiety. It is based on the following:
1. Psychological problems are based, in part, on faulty or unhelpful ways of thinking.
2. Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior.
3. People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives.

In CBT, the psychologist/psychiatrist work together to develop an understanding of the problem and treatment strategy.

Another first line treatment is pharmacological management, predominantly using  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and selective noradrenaline
reuptake inhibitors (SNRI). Pregabalin (a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel modulator) may also be used. However, these may initially increase symptoms before taking effect in 1-6 weeks.

Some side effects include 
- feeling agitated, shaky or anxious
- indigestion and stomach aches
- diarrhea or constipation
- loss of appetite
- dizziness
- not sleeping well (insomnia), or feeling very sleepy
- headaches
- loss of libido
- difficulties achieving orgasm and erectile dysfunction

Exercise and physical activity alongside CBT have been shown to be helpful without the adverse side effects of drugs. Treating anxiety can often relieve some of its complications, including epigastric upset.



## Clinical

### Cardiac Exam [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459220/)

#### History Taking
Check for chest pain. Angina (chest pain due to lack of oxygen to part of the heart) is typically retrosternal and diffuse, radiating to left arm and jaw. Feels like pressure on the heart and is increased by exertion. Also ask about palpations or "skipping beats", dyspnea (paroxysmal and on exertion), syncope, fatigue, and edema.

#### Inspection
Note nourishment and skin temperature (cool parts indicate poor perfusion). Xanthomata indicates hypercholesterolemia. Check for perfusion in nailbed capillaries and look for splinter hemorrhages (associated with infective endocarditis). Jugular venous pulse abnormalities in the neck can be indicative of AFib, stenosis of tricuspid or pulmonic valve, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac tamponade. JVD can give RA pressure estimate. 

Dependent edema is an important finding and is graded on a scale of +1 to +4:
 - +1: up to 2mm pitting with immediate rebound
 - +2: 3-4mm with <15s rebound
 - +3: 5-6mm with <1min rebound
 - +4: 8+mm with >1min rebound

#### Palpation
 - Arterial pulse: count radial pulse for 30s to obtain HR. Report regular, regularly irregular, or irregularly irregular.
 - Blood pressure
 - Thrills: feel for vibratory sensations on skin over heart indicating turbulence and allowing for murmur grading
 - Point of maximal impulse (PMI): check 5th intercostal near midclavicular line. Displaced PMI can indicate cardiomegaly.


#### Auscultation

Listen to aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral regions with diaphragm of stethoscope and patient in supine, left lateral decubitus (on the side), upright, and upright leaning forward positions.
![Auscultation Points](\img\AuscultationPoints.PNG)

Left lower sternal border should be checked for S3 and S4 heart sounds. Mitral stenosis murmur is a diastolic murmur heard most easily in the left lateral decubitus position. Check for S1 and S2 sounds along with any systolic or diastolic murmurs while patient is upright. Pleural rubs should be checked while patient is leaning forward. Note right sided murmurs can be accentuated with inspiration.

Carotid pulse can assist with murmur ID. Murmurs before pulse are S1, and murmurs after are S2. Murmurs are graded I-VI and identified via timing and crescendo/decrescendo of the sound.

### Abdominal Exam

#### Inspection - General

Expose patient from nipples to pubic bone. Notice any jaundice or other abnormal skin appearance. Tremors should be noted and can indicate hepatic encephalopathy or alcohol withdrawal. Ateriovenous fistula indicates dialysis. Brownish-green Kayser-Fleischer ring around cornea periphery can be seen in Wilson's disease, and peri-orbital plaques can indicate cholestasis. 

Lesions around corners of mouth indicate iron or vitamin deficiency and oral ulcers can be signs of Crohn's or celiac disease. Tongue can indicate vitamin and mineral deficiencies and breath can reveal hepatic disorders or ketosis.

#### Inspection - Abdominal

Distension can present due to small bowel obstruction, masses, tumors, cancer, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, constipation, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and pregnancy. The presence of any abnormal masses may indicate umbilical hernia, ventral wall hernia, femoral hernia, or inguinal hernia, depending on the location, which is exaggerated on cough.

Ecchymosis of the flank and groin is seen in hemorrhagic pancreatitis while periumbilical ecchymosis results from retroperitoneal hemorrhage or intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Pink stretch marks can indicate Cushing's syndrome and 'Caput Medusa' (distended veins away from umbilicus) are quite specific to hepatic cirrhosis.

#### Palpation

Have patient lie down with arms to sides and head relaxed. Always start far away from painful regions. Superficial palpation to detect crepitus (crunchy sensation) or hernia/lipoma is first. Then deep palpation with slow pressure at each of the 9 abdominal regions is performed, watching for pain or abdominal muscle contraction, engaging in conversation if needed to stop voluntary contraction (see above chart for differential dx of tenderness at different regions).

Organ palpation follows:
 - Liver: place hand under right lower rib margin and have patient exhale and inhale - liver margin may be felt as gentle wave, noting nodes or tenderness.
 - Gallbladder: place hand under right lower rib margin, exhale as much as possible, and push deeper, then inhale, watching for pain (acute cholecytitis).
 - Spleen: splenomegaly palpable with mild pressure under lower left rib margin after exhale and inhale.
 - Kidneys and aorta may also be palpated. The rectum and prostate can be evaluated via digital rectal exam if necessary.

#### Percussion

Dullness of percussion over air-filled structures may be present due to underlying mass. Can be used when suspecting hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and to assess liver size.

#### Ascultation 

Bowel sounds should occur 2-5 times/minute. Aortic bruit is audible above umbilicus and 2cm above and lateral to umbilicus reveals renal bruit. Uncomfortable test to determined delayed gastric emptying is shaking patient by hips and listening for splashing sounds in abdomen.

## SoDoH
#### Chronic Stress
Chronic stress contributes to high blood pressure, promotes the formation of artery-clogging deposits, and causes brain changes that may contribute to anxiety, depression, and addiction.. More preliminary research suggests that chronic stress may also contribute to obesity, both through direct mechanisms (causing people to eat more) or indirectly (decreasing sleep and exercise). 

Stress can lead to changes in the serum level of many hormones including glucocorticoids, catecholamines, growth hormone and prolactin. In particular, the activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis results in hypothalamic secretion of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) which stimulates adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) release from pituitary. ACTH in turn causes cortisol release in adrenal glands.

#### Translators and Advocates [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25369625)

Untrained interpreters are more likely to make errors, violate confidentiality, and increase the risk of poor outcomes. Children should never be used as interpreters except in emergencies. When using an interpreter, the clinician should address the patient directly and seat the interpreter next to or slightly behind the patient. Statements should be short, and the discussion should be limited to three major points. In addition to acting as a conduit for the discussion, the interpreter may serve as a cultural liaison between the physician and patient.

What is a healthcare advocate and what is the role of a translator?
How does a family member compare to a professional translator in the medical setting?
Are patients less likely to adhere to treatments for psychological conditions compared to physiological illness?
How does caring for the elderly impact the health of the caretakers?

#### Stigma and Adherence

Adherence to lifestyle recommendations is associated with adherence to pharmaceutical recommendations and vice versa. Moreover, patients who adhere to medical therapies tend to pursue health-seeking behaviors

People in racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. are less likely than white people to seek outpatient therapy services. Many ethnic minority groups are more comfortable going to their primary care physicians or family members for assistance with mental health symptoms as opposed to speaking with a mental health provider.

Among Latinos caring for a relative with schizophrenia, mental health stigma was related to more depressive symptoms suggesting that stigma kept them from speaking about their relative to others and obtaining needed social support (19). An examination of older Latinos found that they reported a greater embarrassment concerning having mental illness than that of African Americans or European Americans, and that this shame may be related to beliefs about disappointing family [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5834514/).

High levels of self-stigma are associated with discontinuation of medications without a psychiatrist’s recommendation. Self-stigma is higher in individuals lower education and in single individuals.

See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881446/) for correlation between lack of insurance and access to care. Note that uninsured patients were more likely to turn to OTC medication as the only form of treatment than insured patients.


#### Confidentiality Training

Health professionals have a limited attitude towards patient confidentiality but have relatively good knowledge. Providing a continuing medical ethics training package for health workers before joining the hospital and in between the working time is recommended to enhance health professionals’ knowledge and attitude towards patient confidentiality [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8922732/).

58 % of all residents self-report violating HIPAA by sharing protected health information (PHI) via text messaging with 27 % reporting they do it "often" or "routinely" compared to 15-19 % of attendings.

Some conditions must be reported, including AIDS, Covid, Hepatitis, and TB. The comprehensive list for Texas is available [here](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/IDCU/investigation/Reporting-forms/Notifiable-Conditions-2023BW2.pdf).
