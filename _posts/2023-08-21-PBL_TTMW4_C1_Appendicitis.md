## Appendicitis

Appendicitis is the inflammation of the vermiform appendix. It typically presents  within 24 hours of onset with generalized or periumbilical abdominal pain that later localizes to the right lower quadrant.

### Pathophysiology
Appendicitis is usually due to fecalith, but can also develop due to other obstruction such as appendiceal tumors, intestinal parasites, or hypertrophied lymphatic tissue. This results in bacterial buildup and accompanying inflammation, ischemia, and potential perforation with or without development of a contained abscess. Uncontained perforation results in peritonitis which can lead to death. 

#### Presentation
The appendix is usually located in the LRQ (retrocecal area). Pain initially presents generally but as the appendix becomes more inflamed, it centralizes to the LRQ.

Appendicitis may be accompanied by anorexia, nausea/vomiting, fever, diarrhea, malaise, and/or increased urinary frequency. Physical exam findings include:
 - Right lower quadrant guarding and rebound tenderness over McBurney's point (1.5 to 2 inches from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) on a straight line from the ASIS to the umbilicus)
 - Rovsing's sign (right lower quadrant pain elicited by palpation of the left lower quadrant)
 - Dunphy's sign (increased abdominal pain with coughing)

Other associated signs such as the psoas sign (pain on external rotation or passive extension of the right hip suggesting retrocecal appendicitis) or obturator sign (pain on internal rotation of the right hip suggesting pelvic appendicitis) are rare.

#### Lab Testing

Laboratory measurements, including total leucocyte count, neutrophil percentage, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, are requested to proceed with diagnostic steps in patients with suspected acute appendicitis.
 - Elevated white blood cells count (WBC) with or without a left shift or bandemia is classically present, but up to one-third of patients with acute appendicitis will present with a normal WBC count. Count of around 10,000 cells/mm^3 is typical in appendicitis and counts > 17,000 cells/mm^3  are indicative of perforated and/or gangrenous appendicitis.
 - There are usually ketones found in the urine, and the C-reactive protein may be elevated.
 - A combination of normal WBC and CRP results has a specificity of 98% for the exclusion of acute appendicitis. 

#### Imaging

 - An abdominal CT scan has greater than 95% accuracy for the diagnosis of appendicitis and is used with increasing frequency. CT criteria for appendicitis include an enlarged appendix (greater than 6 mm in diameter), appendiceal wall thickening (greater than 2 mm), peri-appendiceal fat stranding, appendiceal wall enhancement, the presence of appendicolith (approximately 25% of patients)

 - If compression can be tolerated by patients, ultrasound can be used. A specific index of compressibility along with a diameter of less than 5 mm is used to exclude appendicitis. On the contrary, several evidence, including an anteroposterior diameter of above 6 mm, an appendicolith, and abnormally increased echogenicity of the peri-appendiceal fat, are suggestive of acute appendicitis. 
 - Despite high sensitivity and specificity, MRI is seldom used except in patients where radiation is unacceptable such as pregnant women due to expense and expertise required for interpretation. 

#### Treatment

The gold standard is laparoscopic surgery. Open surgery is preferred in cases with abscess or advanced infection. Percutaneous drainage is indicated when known abscess causes excessive inflammation that interferes with surgery. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often administered pre-op and continued for several weeks in the case of abscess. 

Nonsurgical treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181971/) via antibiotics alone has shown significant promise in recent studies, albeit with a high rate (16-40% after 1 year) of reoccurrence. Treatment via abx alone is contraindicated in pregnant women, immunosuppressed patients, those with a mechanical heart valve, in cases where severity of the appendicitis is unclear, in non-compliant patients, and when fecalith is found. 

Commonly used abx for appendicitis include amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and cephalosporins.

### Beta-lactams

Beta-lactams are bactericidal agents that covalently bind to a serine active site on one or more essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the cell wall of both Gram(-) and Gram(+) bacteria. 

Amoxicillin in particular covers a wide range of Gram(+) bacteria and some negative. Some bacteria have developed resistance to beta-lactams including amoxicillin via production of beta-lactamase hence the use of beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid. 

Cephalosporins are a subclass of Beta-lactams which can be further divided into 5 generations with varying coverage. Some later generation cephalosprins are reserved for use in suspected abx-resistant infections.

## Clinical

### Code Blue
Code blue is used to indicate a major medical emergency, usually cardiac or respiratory arrest. Teams may use more than one method to revive someone. These methods include CPR, intubation, a defibrillator and medications. There may be people assigned to each of these activities, with the process coordinated by one person. The “crash cart” holds all the supplies needed in code blue situations.

### GI ROS

Check for: trouble swallowing, heartburn, appetite, nausea, recent abdominal surgery. Ask for bowel movement frequency, stool color and size, changes in bowel habits, pain with defecation, rectal bleeding or black/tarry stools, hemorrhoids, constipation, and diarrhea. Finally, inquire about abdominal pain, food intolerance, excessive gas or belching, jaundice, past liver or gallbladder trouble, and pregnancy in women of childbearing age.

#### Insurance terminology: see [[ref]](https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/files/downloads/dwnlds/uniform-glossary-final.pdf)

_Note_: Out-of-network charges can be significantly more than rates would suggest. For example, a plan may offer to pay 80% of in-network charges and 60% of out-of-network charges. However, they may not recognize non-discounted rates charged by out-of-network providers and fail to cover the difference between discounted and actual rates entirely.

### Appendectomy Recovery [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32266786/)

The recovery process depends on the type of surgery (open vs. laparoscopic) and severity of the appendicitis. Wound infection and rehospitalization rates are drastically higher in perforated (7x) and gangrenous (6x) appendicitis. Laparoscopic surgery has an infection rate about 50% as high as that of open surgery in uncomplicated cases, and is still significantly lower in complicated cases.

Most patients with uncomplicated appendicitis leave 1-2 days after surgery and are able to return to normal activity within 1-3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 2-4 weeks following open surgery. Surgeons can insert a drain for complicated cases, however recent literature indicates this increases rate of complications and hospital stay and should be done sparingly [[ref]](https://wjes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13017-022-00421-3)

### Pre-op Visit


Patients should ideally be made aware of risks and benefits of surgery well ahead of the scheduled operation date. Additionally, a history and physical examination, focusing on risk factors for cardiac, pulmonary and infectious complications, and a determination of a patient's functional capacity, are essential to any preoperative evaluation. Routine laboratory studies are rarely helpful except to monitor known disease states. Patients with good functional capacity do not require preoperative cardiac stress testing in most surgical cases. 

Unstable angina, myocardial infarction within six weeks and aortic or peripheral vascular surgery place a patient into a high-risk category for perioperative cardiac complications. Patients with respiratory disease may benefit from perioperative use of bronchodilators or steroids. Patients at increased risk of pulmonary complications should receive instruction in deep-breathing exercises or incentive spirometry. Assessment of nutritional status should be performed. An albumin level of less than 3.2 mg per dL (32 g per L) suggests an increased risk of complications. Patients deemed at risk because of compromised nutritional status may benefit from pre- and postoperative nutritional supplementation.

### Keeping up with Literature [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.036141)

Continuing medical education has been shown to increase patient health outcomes and improve physician knowledge [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758945). However, selection of relevant sources is important. Journal surveillance, either on your own or via services such as The New England Journal of Medicine's _Journal Watch_ which has experts review the literature in various fields, select the most important articles, summarize the findings, and discuss their clinical implications. 


### Physician-Patient Disagreement [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720466/)

Like most issues in medical ethics, this ‘problem’ is often one of perception. Simply stated, both the parent and the physician feel that they are acting in the patient's best interest. After acknowledging this fundamental point, the physician should try to determine why there is a disagreement. Clearly addressing your own reasoning along the lines of both beneficence and nonmaleficence. Emphasizing that you want to collaborate to reach a mutually agreeable outcome can then open up rational discussion.


## Social Determinants

### Expenses and Debt

A typical appendectomy costs 7-35k+ without insurance. More complicated cases and laparoscopic procedures are typically more expensive. Insurance covers the procedure but various copays and coinsurance of 10-50% up to the yearly out of pocket maximum can still add up to several thousand dollars.

Medical debt is the most common debt collection tradeline in the US and is thought to be greater than 200 billion nationwide. Around 4.5% of americans owe more than 2,000 in debt. The distribution of debt is skewed toward Black and Hispanic populations, and is greater in low-income and young-adult populations of all ethnicities. 

#### Cost Setting

The costs of services are set by individual hospitals and outlined in a document known as the chargemaster rates. However, almost no one actually pays the publicized chargemaster rates. The vast majority of health care consumers are represented by a payer of some kind, such as a commercial health insurance company, Medicaid, or Medicare. Commercial insurers negotiate the actual prices they pay during the process of contracting with providers. Medicare and Medicaid establish their own payment levels independent of hospitals’ chargemaster lists – Medicare through the federal government and Medicaid through state governments. 

Hospital price transparency helps Americans know the cost of a hospital item or service before receiving it. Starting January 1, 2021, each hospital operating in the United States will be required to provide clear, accessible pricing information online about the items and services they provide in two ways:

 - As a comprehensive machine-readable file with all items and services.
 - In a display of shoppable services in a consumer-friendly format.

CMS audits a sample of hospitals, in addition to investigating complaints that are submitted to CMS, and hospitals may face civil monetary penalties for noncompliance.

### Medical Bill Services

Generally, if your income is less than or equal to 200% of the federal poverty guidelines you may receive some financial assistance from Texas Health. Many hospitals also have individual financial assistance programs that can reduce or eliminate debt based on income and other measures. The [national financial resource directory](https://www.patientadvocate.org/explore-our-resources/national-financial-resource-directory/) provides a list of personalized resources based on patient needs.

Worst case scenario here is still good.
