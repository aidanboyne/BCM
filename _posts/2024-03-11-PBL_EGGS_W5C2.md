# Gynecological Cancers

### BRCA 1 and BRCA2

Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are significant  genetic risk factors for breast cancer and many gynecological cancers. A summary of BRCA associated cancers is given below [[ref: Yukihide Momozawa]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2791277)

![BRCA Risk](/img/BRCA_associtions.png)

## Ovarian Cancer

- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Genetic: BRCA 1 and BRCA2, Lynch Syndrome (mismatch repair gene mutations in one or more of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6)
  - HRT: Estrogen only increases risk by roughly 22% while combined replacement increases risk by 10%
  - Obesity
- **Protective Factors**
  - Oral contraceptives
  - Parity (especailly in clear-cell carcinoma)
  - Oopherectomy
  - Tubal Ligation and Histerectomy
  
### Diagnosis

Most women are symptomatic at disease presentation and have ascites (fluid in the peritoneal cavity) and gastrointestinal dysfunction (for example, constipation and/or bowel obstruction, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal reflux). Other symptoms at initial presentation include abdominal bloating, abdominal and/or pelvic pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201661) Diagnosis often occurs late. Clear-cell and small cell carcinomas may present earlier than HGSC.

Workup includes ultrasound, CT, MRI, and/or PET. Laproscopic removal with lymph node biopsy will help with staging. Though not effective alone, CA125 can be used as a marker for recurrence and treatment success.

### Treatment

Primary surgery for cytoreduction is always indicationed. Often the surgery requires en bloc bowel, uterus, and adenexal mass resection as well as peritonectomy. Systematic para-aortic lymph node dissection is indicated in high-risk early stage ovarian cancer to guide management. Platinum based therapy is effective in many cases.

## Vaginal and Cervical Cancers

The primary risk factors for vaginal and cervical cancers are HPV infections. Carcinogenic strains include **16, 18, 31**, and **33**. Strains more classically associated with condylomas (benign warts of the vulva and vagina) are **6S** and **11**

# Breast Cancer [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0111-2)

_See previous case on breast cancer [here](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/posts/PBL_TTMM3_C1_BreastCancer/)_

Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women and is a heterogeneous disease on the molecular level. 

![Breast Cancer](/img/Breast_cancer_2.webp)

All breast cancers arise in the terminal duct lobular units (the functional unit of the breast) of the collecting duct. The histological and molecular characteristics have important implications for therapy, and several classifications on the basis of molecular and histological characteristics have been developed. The histological subtypes described here (top right) are the most frequent subtypes of breast cancer; ductal carcinoma (now referred to as ‘no special type’ (NST)) and lobular carcinoma are the invasive lesions; their preinvasive counterparts are ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ (or lobular neoplasia), respectively. 

### Risk Factors 

BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with an average cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by the age of 80 years of 72% and 69%, respectively, the relative risk of breast cancer in men harbouring BRCA2 mutations is 6%. Other syndromes include **Li-Fraumeni** syndrome which involves TP53 mutations and classically results in HER2+ adenocarcinomas and Phyllodes tumors, **Cowden** syndrome (PTEN), **Peutz-Jegher** syndrome (STK11), **Neurofibromatosis** (NF1), **Ataxia Telangiectasia** (ATM), and _CHECK2_ or _PALB2_ (biallelic = Fanconi anemia) mutations.

The major risk factors for sporadic breast cancer are linked to hormone exposure. Estrogen is clearly a promoter of breast cancer, through its binding of the ER located in the nucleus (encoded by ESR1), which is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Hormones stimulate breast development during puberty, menstrual cycles and pregnancy (the only period when the organ is functional). During the menstrual cycles, an imbalance between oestrogen and progesterone enhances cell proliferation and may cause DNA damage accumulation. With the repetition of the process at each cycle, a defective repair process can occur, leading to mutations in pre-malignant, and then in malignant, cells. 

### Screening and Diagnosis

Population screening for breast cancer using mammography is a secondary prevention strategy aimed at detecting the disease at an early stage to enable effective treatment and has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality by up to 30% in patients under 50 and up to 40% in patients over 50, with strongest evidence in women 50-69 years old. The most frequent harm from mammography screening is false-positive recall.

### Histology

![Breast Histo](/img/breast_histo.webp)

A sentinel lymph node biopsy is accurate to assess axillary node status in clinical node-negative (that is, not palpable and not visible on imaging) disease, and avoids unnecessary axillary clearance with its associated morbidity.

### Treatment

![Breast Treat](/img/breast_treat.webp)

Selection factors for breast-conserving surgery include tumour to breast size relationship, number of tumours, tumour biology and the patient’s preference (after adequate information). Even complex surgical situations can be managed with satisfying aesthetic results. In the event mastectomy is inevitable, procedures should be undertaken with the option of subsequent reconstrutive procuedres via sparing of uninvolved muscle, blood, and skin. 

Modern regional lymph node radiation therapy improves disease outcome without increasing non-breast-cancer-related mortality. Generally, patients with large tumours (>5 cm)166 with extensive lymph node involvement (>3 axillary nodes), or in the presence of other unfavourable risk factors, receive lymph node radiation therapy; however, no consensus has been reached on the use of lymph node radiation therapy in lower-risk patients, including those with 1–3 involved axillary lymph nodes

Advanced breast cancer comprises inoperable locally advanced breast cancer, which has not spread to distant organs, and metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer; common sites of spread are bone, the lungs, the liver, and the brain. Advanced disease is treatable but nearly incurable and almost always results in death due to metastisis within 3 years.

## Case Pharmacology

- **Doxorubicin**: Doxorubicin is an anti-tumor antibiotic and part of the anthracycline group of chemotherapeutic agents; other anthracyclines include daunorubicin, idarubicin, and epirubicin. It intercalates within DNA strands and inhibits topoisomerase II, causing DNA damage in rapidly replicating cells such as tumor cells. It also can form free radicals with iron which cause oxidative damage [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/).
- **Paclitaxel**: Paclitaxel is an antimicrotuble agent, enhancing the assembly and stability of microtubules and inhibiting their breakdown. This causes disruption of cell division and induciton of apoptosis due to prolong cellular arrest in G2/M phase [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536917/).
- **Tamoxifen**: Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) which antagonistically competes with estrogen at breast tissue, slowing cell cycling and acting as a cytostatic agent. However, it stimulates estrogen resceptors in bone and the endometrium of the postmenopausal uterus (due to low endogenous estrogen levels) and has been associated with uterine and endometrial malignancies [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532905/).
- **Cyclophosphamide**: Nitrogen mustard alkylating agent. It is not cell cycle specific and acts via cross linking of DNA and RNA. It is metabolized to the active agent and acrolein. The active phophoramide binds guanines at the N-7 position, while acreolin is associated with the adverse effect of hemorrhagic cystitis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553087/).
- **Carboplatin**: Carboplain is a platinum based alkylating agen which cross links DNA and RNA, approved for ovarian carcinoma. It is thought to be less toxic than cisplatin, but still has a similar side effect profile including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow supression, and neuro-, oto-, and nephrotoxic effects [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548565/).
- **Olaparib**: an oral poly(ADO-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. It competitivley inhibits NAD+ at the catylitic site of PARP1 and PARP2 which are central to the repair of DNA single stranded breaks (SSBs) mediated via the base excision repair pathway. This leads to the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs which result in double stranded breaks that are lethal in tumors with homologous recombination pathway mutations (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations) [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30069770/).
- **Palbociclib**: Palbociclib is a highly selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor that acts by binding to the ATP pocket used in resistant HR+ HER2- breast cancer. The CDK4/6 kinase is involved, with coregulatory partner cyclin D, in the G1-S transition. Thus, inhibition by palbociclib results in a halted cell cycle.
