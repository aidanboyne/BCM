## The Heart and its Defects

### Tetralogy of Fallot

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, representing 5% to 7% of all congenital heart defects. TOF is a conotruncal cardiac defect characterized by a large and anteriorly malaligned ventricular septal defect, an overriding aortic root, and narrowing of the subpulmonary and pulmonary valves. Right ventricular hypertrophy is secondary to the obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513288/)

"Tet spells" or hypercyanotic episodes can occur in infants or toddlers with unrepaired TOF, characterized by tachypnea and hyperpnea and a decrease in the intensity of the cardiac murmur.

Typical findings on chest radiography include a normal-size heart silhouette with an upturned apex and a concave or "boot-shaped" main pulmonary artery segment. Right axis deviation, prominent R or qR waves in V1, and upright T waves in V1, characteristic of right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy, are common on the electrocardiogram.

Tetralogy of Fallot may have a normal radiographic appearance particularly in "pink Tets" who have adequate pulmonary circulation either because of minimal right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or because of co-existent aorto-pulmonary collaterals. Indeed some patients may have evidence of clinical overcirculation secondary to excessive aorto-pulmonary collateral blood flow, manifested by high saturations and increased pulmonary markings on chest film.

### Fluid overload

Congestion, or fluid overload, is a classic clinical feature of patients presenting with HF. In some patients, pulmonary congestion develops very rapidly because of a sudden increase in LV filling pressures, and a precipitating factor is often recognised, such as acute myocardial ischaemia, or uncontrolled hypertension. In this circumstance, the edema is localised predominantly to the pulmonary airspaces (pulmonary edema), while the total amount of fluid in the cardiovascular system remains unchanged. 

Cardiogenic or volume-overload pulmonary edema arises due to a rapid elevation in the hydrostatic pressure of the pulmonary capillaries. This is typically seen in disorders involving left ventricular systolic and diastolic function (acute myocarditis including other etiologies of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction), valvular function (aortic/mitral regurgitation and stenosis in the moderate to the severe range), rhythm (atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, ventricular tachycardia, high degree, and third-degree heart block) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557611/). 

This presents clinically as dyspnea, tachypnea, and rales on exam with associated hypoxia. Fine crackles are heard in the inspiratory phase of cardiogenic pulmonary demea. Diuretics are the mainstay of treatment.

### Trisomy 21

The most common CHD lesions include atrioventricular septal defet, VSD, and ASD [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370349/). Less common associations include PDA and tetralogy of Fallot. The association is though to be caused by preturbation of cardiac progenitor cells prior to migration to the heart tube.

### Murmurs

* Aortic valve: second intercostal space at the right sternal border
* Pulmonary valve: second intercostal space at the left sternal border
* Tricuspid valve: fourth intercostal space at the left sternal border
* Mitral valve: fifth intercostal space at the left midclavicular line

![Auscultate](/img/AuscultationPoints.PNG)

Murmurs are graded by intensity as follows:

* Grade I: faint murmur, barely audible
* Grade II: soft murmur
* Grade III: easily audible but without a palpable thrill
* Grade IV: easily audible murmur with a palpable thrill
* Grade V: loud murmur, audible with stethoscope lightly touching the chest
* Grade VI: loudest murmur, audible with stethoscope not touching the chest

Diastolic murmurs occur at or after S2, while systolic occur at or after S1. Several manuvers to increase/decrease intensity include:
- Handgrip = up afterlood. Increases aortic regurg, mitral regurge, VSD. Decreases hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral prolapse
- Squatting = up preload. Increase aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurg, mitral regurg. Decreases hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral prolapse
- Valsalva: down preload. Increases hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, mitral prolapse. Decreases aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurg, mitral regurg, and VSD

In this case, the patient has a III/VI right sternal murmur, probably indicating an anomalous pulmonary venous return or ASD, atrial septal aneurysm, or pulmonary stenosis.

## Sepsis/SIRS

Adult SIRS is defined by 2 or more of the following criteria:
* Body temperature over 38 or under 36 degrees Celsius.
* Heart rate greater than 90 beats/minute
* Respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths/minute or partial pressure of CO2 less than 32 mmHg
* Leukocyte count greater than 12000 or less than 4000 /microliters or over 10% immature forms or bands.

Pediatrics require abnormal leukocyte count or temperature due to the more common HR and RR alterations.

## Infective Endocarditis

IE disproportionately affects those with underlying structural heart disease and is increasingly associated with health care contact, particularly in patients who have intravascular prosthetic material. In the setting of bacteraemia with a pathogenic organism, an infected vegetation may form as the end result of complex interactions between invading microorganisms and the host immune system.

### Epidemiology

Infective endocarditis is highly deadly and mortailty approaches 25% even with best-available therapy. Underlying risk factors include rheumatic heart disease (especailly in developing countries) and degenerative valvular disease. Prosthetic valves and cardiac devices such as permanent pacemakes and cardioverter defibrillators are significant risk factors, associated with 20% and 7% of IE cases respectivley. 12% have underlying congenital heart disease. Othre risk facturs include IV drug use, HIV, and extensive health care system contact.

![IE Bacteria](/img/IE_bacteria.webp)

About 10% of IE cases have negative blood culture. In these cases, fastidious microoganisms such as Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp., Brucella spp. and Tropheryma whipplei are possible etiologies. 

### Pathophysiology

![Valve attachment](/img/endocarditis_mechanism.webp)

Damage to the cardiac valve surface is required to allow bacterial attachment and colonization. The bacteria then cause a vegitation via buildup of a protective matrix of serum molecules. Inciting events can include disease state (rheumatic carditis), mechanical injury via catheter, electrode, or surgery, or injury due to solid particles in the blood.

Bacteremia seems to be required for IE, especially in the case of native valve infection (though seeding prior to implantation may be seen in prosthetic valves). Bacteremia may result from mucosal trauma (dental, GI, GU) but is likley not high enough grade to cause IE in most immune competent patients. Once bacteria bind to the damaged endothelium or non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis site (via attachment to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen), virulence factors such as alpha-toxin in S. Aureus, allow persistence of colonies. Some strains of bacteria induce platlet aggregation and degranulation allowing for further colonization. Platlets do play a role in resisting endocarditis by releasing antibacterial platlet microbicidal proteins in their alpha granules, but some bacteria are resistant. 

### Cardiobacterium Homonius

C. hominis is a **pleomorphic gram-negative bacillus** that often appears as pairs, short chains, teardrop forms, rosettes, or clusters. The organism is often gram variable, with one or both ends retaining the crystal violet stain and appearing to be gram positive. It grows well on blood and chocolate agar but poorly on MacConkey.
- **Gram (-)**
- **Oxidate (+)**
- **Catalse (-)**

C. hominis is part of the normal nose and throat flora and is generally avirulent. It is more associated with congestive heart failure than other HACEK organisms. 

Patients with C. hominis infection have a long duration of symptoms preceding diagnosis (138±128 days). The most common symptoms were fever (74%), fatigue/malaise (53%), weight loss/anorexia (40%), night sweats (24%), and arthralgia/myalgia (21%). The most common risk factors were pre-existing cardiac disease (61%), the presence of a prosthetic valve (28%), and history of rheumatic fever (20%). Of the 61 cases reviewed here, the aortic valve was infected in 24 (39%) and the mitral valve in 19 (31%) patients. The average duration of blood culture incubation before growth was detected was 6.3 days (range, 2–21 days). Complications were congestive heart failure (40%), central nervous system (CNS) emboli (21%), arrhythmia (16%), and mycotic aneurysm (9%). C. hominis is almost always susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics. Ceftriaxone is recommended by the recently published American Heart Association guidelines. The prognosis of C. hominis native valve and prosthetic valve endocarditis is favorable. The cure rate among 60 patients reviewed was 93% (56/60). For prosthetic valve endocarditis, the cure rate was 16/17 (94%). Valve replacement was required in 27 (45%) cases. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2276845/)

### Other HACEK Bacteria

HACEK organisms (Haemophilus spp., Aggregatibacter spp., Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella spp.) are all **gram negative** bacteria that form part of the normal oral and URT flora. They are associated with peridontal disease, bacterima, polymicrobial wound infections, and endocarditis.

![HAECK MICRO](/img/HACEK_microbio.png)

Most patients with HACEK IE present with fever, splenomegaly, new or altered murmurs, and micro embolic or immunologic phenomena. These organisms are associated with good IE prognosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment

**Duke Criteria**
- Pathological (definite diagnosis with either criteria)
    - Microorganism in vegatation via culture or histologic examination of vegitation, septic embolus, or intracardiac abscess
    - Pathologic lesion confirmed by histologic exam
- Major
    - Positive blood culture: (from 2 separate cultures, 1 for coxiella burnetti, antiphase IgG Ab > 1/8000)
    - Echo positive for IE: abscess, new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve, or new valvular regurgitation
- Minor
    - Predisposing heart condition or IV drug use
    - Fever
    - Vascular phenomena (emboli, mycotic aneurysm, janeway)
    - Immunologic phenomena (glomerulonephritis, osler, roth, Rh+)
    - Microbiological evidence not meeting major criterion

Based on the above, IE is
- **Confirmed**: 2 major or 1 major + 3 minor, 5 minor
- **Possible**: 1 major + 2 minor, 3 minor

TOE is more sensitive than TTE, especially for prosthetic valves. Cardiac MRI and PET-CT can also be used. Typical microorganisms for IE include viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus gallolyticus, HACEK organisms, Staphylococcus aureus and community-acquired enterococci in the absence of a primary focus.

Though not dignostic, IE is characterized by conduction abnormalities, low QRS voltage, ST elevation, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia on EKG.

#### Surgical Management

The principal consensus indications for valve surgery are heart failure, uncontrolled infection and prevention of embolic events in patients at high risk of IE. Uncontrolled infection may be related to paravalvular complications, such as abscess, an enlarging vegetation or dehiscence of a prosthetic valve. In addition, uncontrolled infection may be manifested by ongoing systemic illness with persistent fevers and positive blood cultures despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. As larger left-sided vegetations are more likely to lead to embolic events, IE with a vegetation of >10 mm in length is a relative indication for surgical intervention.

Patients with prosthetic valves should recive a longer treatment course (typically 6 weeks vs. 2 weeks for natural valve IE). Some metastatic foci, such as vertebral osteomyelitis, may require additional antibiotic therapy beyond what is typically indicated for IE

### Complications

* **Cardiac**: vegetations are usually along the line of closure of valuve leaflets and on atrial surface of AV values or ventricular surface of semilunar valves. Spread of infection may cause valvular perforation, rupture of chortae tendinae, interventricular septum perforation, or papillary muscule rupture. MI may occur, especially with aortic-valve IE.
* **Renal**: infarcts, abcessess, or immune complex glomerulonephritis are possible
* **Neurovascular**: mycotic aneurisms due to seeding of vessel walls may occur accutley or several months/years after treatment. Cerebral emboli are also possible, leading to stroke. Pyogenic brain abcesses are also possible
* **Spleen**: splenic infacrts and abcessess may go unnoticed, but can present with pain, fever, and leukocytosis. 
* **Pulmonary**: showers of small emboli can be thrown off of vegitations, causing septic pulmonary emboli with or without infarction resulting in pneumonia, pleural effusion, and empyema. Often present as wedge-shaped densities or cannonball lesions on CXR.
* **Skin**
    * Petechiae
    * Cutaneous Infarcts
    * Osler's Nodes: arteriolar intimal proliferation with extension to venules and capillaries that miay be accompanied by thrombosis and necrosis. Neurtrophils and monocytes surround the vessels.
    * Janeway lesions: septic emboli with bacteria, neutrophils, necrosis, and subQ hemorrhage.

* **Ocular**: Roth spots (retinal hemorrhage with pale center) may be seen on fundoscopic exam
