## Pituitary Adenomas

Tumors of the anterior pituitary. Often benign. They are classified by size as microadenoma (<10mm) macroadenoma (10-40mm) and giant tumors (>40mm). Symptoms can be caused both via excessive hormone secretion and mass effect. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554451/#)

- **Lactorophic**: Eleveated prolactin. Most common endocrine secreting. Causes osteoperosis,infertility and sexual dysfunction (ED). In men, causes gynecomastia and in wommen, amenorrhea and glactorrhea.
    - Treatment: dopamine agonists (cabergoline). Can be discontinued after 2 years with annual serum prolactin checks. Transsphenoidal surgery is another option, while radiation is rarley used.
- **Somatotrophic**: Elevated growth hormone. Can lead to gigantism in children and adolecents (prior to growth plate closure) or acromegaly (increasing shoe size, coarse face, carpal tunnel, enlarged tounge, arthritis...) in adults. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0076-1)
    - Diagnosis by serum IGF1 levels and MRI.
    - Treatment: Reduce GH and IGF1 levels and reduce tumor mass. Trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy is first-line. Medical therapy includes somatostatin receptor ligands (SSAs - i.e. octorecitide, lanreotide, pasireotide) and GH receptor antagonists (pegvisomant). Radiotherapy is another potential option but requires several years for effect.
- **Corticotrophic**: Elevated ACTH leading to adrenal production of cortisol, potentially leading to Cushing's disease (characterized by wieght gain, thinning of skin, fatigue, and HTN). Least common endocrine secreting. Round face with plethora, supraclavicular fat, ecchymoses, and purple striae on the abdomen/armpits are common presenting signs.
    - Elevated ACTH suggests corticotroph adenomas, which are often small and may not show up on MRI. Measurements post CRH can help distinguish from other hypercortisolemias.
    - Treatment: First line is trans-sphenoidal surgery. DAs (cabergoline) and SSAs (pasireotide) are medical options. Ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, and etomidate can decrease cortisol levels. B/l drenalectomy
- **TSH adenomas**: patients present with hyperthyroid symptoms such as palpitations and weight loss. They may have tremor and goiter on exam.

Rarley, loss of function in MEN1, MEN4, or germline CNC/FIPA mutatiosn can cause pituitary adenomas. Patients are typically asymptomatic unless the tumor is hormonally active or large enough to exert mass effect.

### Mass Symptoms
- Visual impairment (optic chiasm compression). Typically bitemporal. Can also cause diplopia (oculomotor nerve)
- Headache
- Hormonal Deficiencies

## Hypopituitarism

Isolated or multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies exist with a variety of causes (congential, neoplastic, vascular, inflammatory, infectious, irradiation, traumatic, and iatrogenic). GHD is often most succeptible to irradiation and traumatic injury.

Baseline investigation of pituitary function includes:

1. Adrenocortical axis: serum cortisol (09.00 AM), ACTH
2. Thyroid axis: free T4, TSH
3. Gonadal axis:
    - Men - testosterone (09.00 AM), SHBG, LH, FSH;
    - Women - estradiol, LH, FSH, progesterone (Day 21 if menstruating)
4. Prolactin
5. Insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone
6. Paired plasma and urine osmolality

### Pharmacology
- **Cabergoline**: synthetic ergoline with high specificity and affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor. It is a potent and very long-acting inhibitor of prolactin secretion. Prolactin-lowering effects occur rapidly and, after a single dose, were evident at the end of follow up (21 days) in puerperal women, and up to 14 days in patients with hyperprolactinaemia.

### Underserved Patient Centered Care

Key takeaways from [Raha et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4437903/pdf/pone.0126708.pdf) include:

* **Empathy and Rapport**: Patients highly value empathy, rapport, and a personal connection with their healthcare providers.
* **Clear Communication**: Effective and clear communication, including step-by-step explanations and avoiding medical jargon, is crucial for positive clinical experiences.
* **Barriers to Preventive Care**: Cost is a significant barrier to engaging in preventive care, with social support and a strong provider-patient relationship serving as key motivators.
* **Holistic Care**: There is a strong desire for holistic, patient-centered care that considers the totality of a patient's health, lifestyle, and environmental factors.
* **Dehumanization in Healthcare**: Patients report feelings of dehumanization within the healthcare system, highlighting the need for more compassionate and culturally competent care.
