* Fever
* Ronchi in LR lung
* No recent hospitalizaiton

The differential is:
* Community acquired pneumonia (bacterial)
* Bronchitis
* COVID-19
* Hodgkin lymphoma
* TB
* Influenza
* PE
* Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia

### CXR
![Lobular, Broncho, Interstitial pneumonias](/img/pneumonias_LBI.pn.PNG)

_From left to right_: Lobular penumonia, bronchopneumonia, interstitial (atypical).pneumonia. Nodular and miliary infiltrates may be seen in fungal and secondary TB infections respectivley.

### Infiltrates
Persistent pulmonary infiltrate results when a substance denser than air (e.g., pus, edema, blood, surfactant, protein, or cells) lingers within the lung parenchyma. Nonresolving and slowly resolving pneumonias are the most common broad categories of persistent pulmonary infiltrate. [[ref]](https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/1094)

Noninfectious causes include drug  allergy, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, paraneoplastic syndromes, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Institial differentials include IPF, NSIP, DIP (desquamative), RB-ILD, AIP, COP, SLE and RA related ILD, and pneumoconiosis or drug/radiation induced ILD.

Other infectious causes include tuberculosis, brucellosis, psittacosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and parasitic infections including ascariasis, strongyloidiasis, paragonimiasis, echinococcosis, visceral larval migrans, cutaneous larva migrans, and infections with Schistosoma, Dirofilaria immitis, and Ancylostoma species. 


# Pathophysiology 

## Sputum
The small amounts of tracheobronchial secretions normally produced are very effectively handled by the mucociliary clearance mechanism. These secretions are made up of water, dialyzable substances such as electrolytes and glucose, mucus glycoprotein, indigenous and transudated proteins, and lipids (surfactant). The mucous glands and goblet cells are the primary sources of the tracheobronchial mucus. By forming a thin blanket, the airway mucus covers the ciliated epithelium. Rhythmic vibrations of cilia propel it toward the pharynx from where it is swallowed, usually unnoticed. A proper balance between its formation and its clearance maintains a thin protective layer of mucus for trapping and removing the impurities of the inspired air while preventing the excessive accumulation of secretions. With an adequate function of the mucociliary escalator, the cough has no additional benefit in removing the amount of secretions formed under normal conditions. In pathologic states, however, when the mucociliary function is ineffective or insufficient because of the quantity or alteration of the physical properties of secretions, the cough becomes essential for airway clearance.

Yellow sputum indicates the presence of large numbers of white blood cells, especially neutrophilic granulocytes. Yellow and green sputum are indicative of a bacterial infection.

## Community acquired pneumonia [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/)

Typical CAP is caused by either viral agents (rhinovirus, influenza virus) or bacterial agents. Bacteria can be split into typical (Strep. P., H. Flu., Moraxella C. Staph A. GAS, anerobes, and gram (-) organisms), and atypical (Legionella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumonia, and C. psittaci). It is the most common infectious cause of death.

### Presentation

Fever, chills, cough productive of purulent sputum, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and weight loss are common symptoms. The elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, and those who are immune-compromised can have less evident or systemic symptoms such as weakness, lethargy, altered mental status, dyspepsia, or other upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and absence of fever.

Lobular pneumonias often present with bronchophony, egophony, whispered pectoriloquy and coarse crackles (rales) on lung exam. Rhonchi are also possible as seen in this case.

#### Rhonchi

Musical, low-pitched sounds similar to snoring that may be heard on inspiration, expiration, or both. Associated with rupture of fluid films and abnormal airway collapsibility that may clear with coughing. Caused by anything that results in mucosal thickening, moderate edema, or by bronchospasms.


### Diagnosis

CBC, and CMP are needed to confirm inflammation and severity. CXR identifies infiltrates or effusion. Blood and sputum should be collected for hospitalized patients. 

CURB 65 (confusion, urea greater than or equal to 20 mg/dL, respiratory rate greater than or equal to 30/min, blood pressure systolic less than 90 mmHg or diastolic less than 60 mmHg), and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) are tools for severity assessment to determine the treatment setting, such as outpatient versus inpatient, but accuracy is limited when used alone or in the absence of effective clinical judgment.

### Treatment

Culture to allow more targeted therapy should be obtained for inpatient treatment or if patient fails to respond to outpatient therapy.

#### Outpatient
- Without comorbidities: monotherapy with macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin) or doxycycline.
- With comorbidities (CHD, COPD, asthma, chronic alcohol use, DM, smoking, splenectomy, or immunocomprimised): monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (high-dose levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) or a combination of oral beta-lactam (high dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime) and macrolide

#### Inpatient (CURB >= 2)
- Non-ICU: respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy or combination therapy with beta-lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem) and macrolide

- ICU (RR > 30, PaO2/FiO2 < 250, multilobar infiltrates, hypothermia, encephalopathy, lecopenia, hypotension...): combination therapy with a beta-lactam and either a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended. In patients with possible aspiration, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem can be used.

If MRSA risk factors present, add one of:
* IV Vancomycin 
* Linezolid

If Pseudomonas risk factors present, add one of:
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam
* Cefepime
* Ceftazidime
* Imipenem
* Meropenem

Generally patients are treated for 5-7 days if prognosis is favorable (fever reduction, resolution of tachycardia and tachypnea)

Other:
- A five-day therapy with oseltamivir is recommended for all patients who test positive for the influenza virus. For outpatients with delayed presentation (greater than 48 hours from onset of symptoms), there is no benefit. Still, any hospitalized patients with influenza must be treated with this agent irrespective of the time of presentation from the onset of illness. 
-  Prolongation of therapy is indicated in patients with a delayed response, certain bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas (14 to 21 days) or S. aureus (7 to 21 days), or Legionella pneumonia (14 days), and for complications such as empyema, lung abscess, or necrotizing pneumonia. 
- Chest tube placement will be needed to drain an empyema, and in cases with multiple loculations, a surgical decortication may be needed. A 14-day therapy with macrolide or doxycycline will treat tularemia pneumonia or psittacosis, and itraconazole is the drug of choice for pneumonia caused by coccidioidomycosis or histoplasmosis.


#### Complications
- ARDS
- Kidney, liver, and heart damage
- Necrotizing pneumonia
- Pleural disorders
- Sepsis

#### Resolution [[ref]](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/pneumonia/recovery)
Most people can return to normal activity in 1-2 weeks, though severe cases can take a month or more to recover from. General fatigue can persist up to a month even in uncomplicated cases.

### Common culprits
- **Community**: 
    ![CAP](/img/CAP.jpg)
- **Nosocomial**:
    * Gram negative bacilli (64%)
        * Escherichia coli
        * **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** (21%)
        * Klebsiella pneumoniae 
        * Enterobacter cloacae 
    * Gram positive cocci
        * **Staphylococcus aureus** (MRSA >50%)

# Treatment

### Amoxicillin [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482250/)

Amino-penicillin with wide gram-positive and some gram-negative coverage. Hits most Strep. species and also gets Listeria m., Enterococcus spp., H. flu, some E. Coli, Actinomyces, Clostridium, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Corynebacteria. 

In the context of pneumonia, it covers beta-lactamase-negative Streptococcus species (alpha- and beta-hemolytic strains only), pneumococcus, Staphylococcus species, or Haemophilus influenzae. For community-acquired pneumonia, IDSA recommends a combination of amoxicillin and macrolide.

Amoxacillin acts by binding to PBPs via transpeptidation, causing cell wall autolysis. Unlike ampicillin, amoxicillin can be given orally. It can give GI symptoms and lead to hypersensitivity reactions and is mildly nephrotoxic. SJS is serious adverse event.

### Azithromycin [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557766/)

Macrolide derived from erythromycin with high gram-negative and good gram-positive coverage. Azithromycin is effective against many atypical bacteria such as chlamydiae (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydophila psittaci), legionella (i.e., Legionella pneumophila), mycoplasma (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium avium). Together with its activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, azithromycin is indicated—and FDA approved—for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Like other macrolides, azithromycin binds the 23S portion of the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by preventing transit of aminoacyl-tRNA and peptide chain through the ribosome. It is primarily bacteriostatic, but has been shown to have limited bactericidal effects against Strep. and H. Flu. It is available PO, IV, and opthalmically. It is generally safe but can cause QTc prolongation, GI upset, and is mildly hepatotoxic. SJS and C. diff. infection are very rare. 

Something to note is the rise in drug resistant Strep. p. (DRSP), with resistance mutation rates exceeding 60% in certain regions of the US [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494078/) 
- Mef(A)-mediated resistance involves an efflux pump, resulting in low-level resistance. High local concentrations of macrolide antibiotics can overcome this type of resistance mechanism, resulting in good clinical efficacy despite in vitro resistance.
- Erm(B)-mediated resistance involves a conformational change to the macrolide binding site at the bacterial 23S ribosomal subunit. This change confers high-level macrolide resistance.

Only the mountain region of the USA has S. pneumoniae “high-level” (MIC ≥ 16 ug/ml) macrolide resistance rates lower than 25% (Figure 3), which means that most clinicians should reconsider the use of macrolides as monotherapy in CAP. Patients with the following risk factors for DRSP should especially condider alternatives to macrolide monotherapy:

1. Recent antibiotic use (within 3 months)
2. Age greater than 65 years
3. Immunosuppressive illness
4. Multiple medical comorbidities
5. Exposure to a child attending a daycare center
6. Alcohol abuse
7. Asthma/COPD
8. Diabetes mellitus
9. Recent travel

### Organ transplant

* Early < 1 month
    * Bacteria / aspiration / nosocomial pathogens
* Middle 1-6 months
    * CMV
    * Pneumocystis
    * Aspergillus, endemic fungi
    * Nocardia
* Late > 6 months
    * Pneumocystis
    * Aspergillus 
    * Granulomatous – nocardia; reactivation of fungi, mycobacteria

### Immunodeficient Paitents [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9993146/)
* Usual symptoms/signs may or may not be present
* Aggressive diagnostic measures needed - specific etiologic diagnosis is essential
* Differential dx includes non-infectious processes 
    * Immediate empirical treatment while awaiting results of diagnostic tests
* Even HIV patients with normal CD4+ cell counts have higher succeptibility (5x cases, 18x mortaility) than non-HIV patients.

[Table 3 here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9993146/) provides a great overview of oppurtunistic pathogens.

### Other
- **Smoking Status**: smoking damages bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, especially the mucocilliary escalator. Patients who have smoked should be placed on dual therapy or on a more agressive monotherapy (i.e. respiratory fluoroquinolone).
- **Location**: Coccidioidomycosis in the Southwestern United States, blastomycosis or histoplasmosis in the states of the Ohio River valley, bird exposures for Chlamydia psittaci, contact with flea-infested or infected rodent or rabbits during outside activities such as lawn mowing in the Northeast U.S. (Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, etc.) for tularemia pneumonia.
