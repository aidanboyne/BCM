# Gene Mutations

- **Translocation:**
  - *Definition:* Translocation refers to the movement of a chromosomal segment from one location to another within a genome.
  - Ex. t(9;22), or the Philidelphia chromosome, is classic for CML.  t(14;18) is common in follicular lymphoma and may also occur in other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The t(15;17) translocation that generates the PML/RARA is classic in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) which is associated with coagulopathy.
  ![Common translocations](/img/chr_translocation.png)
  - Chromosomal translocations originate from double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are brought into proximity in the nuclear space and joined inappropriately by DNA-repair pathway [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124105249000025).
- **Missense Mutation:**
  - *Definition:* A missense mutation is a genetic alteration that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in a protein sequence.
  - *Clinical Significance:* Depending on the affected protein, missense mutations can lead to functional changes, potentially causing diseases or influencing traits.
- **Nonsense Mutation:**
  - *Definition:* Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon in a gene sequence, leading to truncation of the resulting protein.
  - *Clinical Significance:* Nonsense mutations often result in nonfunctional or truncated proteins, contributing to genetic disorders.
- **Deletion:**
  - *Definition:* Deletion involves the removal or loss of a segment of DNA from a chromosome.
  - *Clinical Significance:* Deletions can disrupt gene function, leading to genetic disorders. **Cytogenic deletion** specifically refers to the visible loss of a chromosomal segment or entire chromosome under a microscope, often associated with syndromes and developmental abnormalities.

## Leukemia Genes

- **FLT3**: receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by immature hematopoietic cells [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/100/5/1532/106333/The-roles-of-FLT3-in-hematopoiesis-and-leukemia). Mutations of FLT3 (most often small tandem duplications in juxtamembrane domain) have been detected in about 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and a small number of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and cause constituative activity. Indicative of poor prgnosis. 
- **K-RAS**: codes for a protein called K-Ras that is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, consisting of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, regulates genes that control cellular development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. [[ref]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/20/5059)
	- KRAS has been deemed a challenging therapeutic target, even “undruggable”, after drug-targeting efforts over the past four decades. Recently, there have been surprising advances in directly targeted drugs for KRAS, especially in KRAS (G12C) inhibitors, such as AMG510 (sotorasib) and MRTX849 (adagrasib), which have obtained encouraging results in clinical trials. AMG510 was the first drug-targeting KRAS (G12C) to be approved for clinical use this year. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00780-4)
- **DNMT3A**: DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) belongs to a family of highly conserved DNA methyltransferases that catalyse 5-methylcytosine methylation. Regulatory domains of DNMT3A allow interactions with histone methyltransferases and histones to influence gene expression. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc3895.pdf)
    ![DNMT3A mutation frequency](/img/DNMT3A.PNG)
- **SET D2:** Histone methyltransferase SETD2, the sole human gene responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity and stability by several distinct pathways. SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair, and depletion of SETD2 shows MSI and an increased spontaneous mutation frequency. SETD2 also provides an alternative mechanism that leads to DNA damage repair through interacting with p53 tumor suppressor. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-021-00193-0)
    ![SETD2](/img/SETD2.png)
- **PTEN:** Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog deleted on Chr. 10 is a dual phosphatase that reduces the levels of PIP3, inhibiting the activation of the PI3K pathway such as AKT and PKC, both of which promote cell growth and survival. [[ref]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00338/full) Congential lack of PTEN can cause diffuse hamartomas
- **JAK 1:** Janus Kinase 1 is a human tyrosine kinase protein essential for signaling for certain type I and type II cytokines. It creates  docking sites for signal transducers and activators of trasnscription (STATs) as part of the JAK-STAT activation pathway. It has been correlated with AML, but JAK2 is more commonly associated with myeloproliferative diseases. [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/111/9/4809/24511/Identification-of-somatic-JAK1-mutations-in)
- **TP53**: Tumor protein 53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer and regulates metabolic functions, apoptotic pathways, cellular sensecence, and DNA repair. TP53 mutations are seen in 5–10% of de novo MDS and AML, but 25–40% of therapy-related MDS and AML. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9496940/)

# Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is the most common childhood malignancy. The term ALL/LBL is used because the current system for diagnosis and classification does not distinguish between clinical presentations as leukemia or lymphoma, accounting for about 1/3 of all childhood cancer.

### Case Differential

- **Presentation**: acute lack of appetite, fatigue, looks unwell (malaise), night sweats, anterior cervical lymph and bilateral axillary hard immoble masses with splenomegaly. Apyretic, no cough, congestion, vomiting, or diarrhea. No recent travel or sick contacts. No recent changes in diet. 
- **Differential**: Epstein-Barr infection, Mononucleosis, Hodgkin lymphoma, _Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma_

### Epidemiology
- **Populations**: about 4000 people in the US are diagnosed each year with a peak age of diagnosis between 2-10y.o. It is strongly associated with Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Bloom syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia. It is more common in males (1.2-1.8:1 in B-ALL, 2.2:1 in T-ALL).
- **Risk Factors**:  certain environmental factors have been implicated in the etiology of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, such as exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, or previous exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Genomic studies have noted that somatic, polymorphic variants of ARD5B, IKZF1 (the gene encoding Ikaros), and CDKN2A are associated with an increased risk of ALL (odds ratio 1.3 to 1.9). Other rare germline mutations in PAX5, ETV6, and particularly p53 can also strongly predispose to the development of leukemia. 
    - **Traffic**: A 2015 meta analysis of environmental risk factors in ALL and AML indicated that overall risk of disease is positivley associated with traffic density near residence, and proximity to petrol station/repair garage. ALL was associated with NO2 exposure, and AML was associated with benzene exposure. [[ref]](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4586078&blobtype=pdf)

## Diagnosis

- Hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly are the most common clinical findings
- Lymphadenopathy
- Fever
- Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and abnormal WBC counts
- MSK pain
- Mediastinal mass (more associated with T-ALL/LBL) with accompanying mass effect is rare but possible

#### CBC and Smear
- **CBC**: typically indicate pancytopenia
- **Smear**: Blast cells in the peripheral smear may approach 90% of the white blood cell (WBC) count. Aplastic anemia, viral infections such as infectious mononucleosis, and vitamin B12 deficiency, and folate deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe pancytopenia. Unlike in AML, Auer rods (linear azurophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of blast cells) are never present in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

![ALL Smear](/img/ALL_smedar.jpg)

#### Marrow Biopsy

![ALL Biopsy](/img/marrow_ALL.jpg)

## Pathophysiology

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a highly aggressive neoplasm of precursor lymphoid (blast) cells with 2 main subtypes based on lymphoid lineage:
* B lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma (B-ALL / LBL)
* T lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma (T-ALL / LBL)

Immature cell markers, such as CD34 and TdT, can help to differentiate lymphoblasts from Burkitt lymphoma which, is considered a mature high grade B cell lymphoma that mimics lymphoblastic lymphoma / leukemia. Children are more likley to have B-ALL (85%) versus T-ALL (15%).

### Cytogenetics
The frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities, including numerical and/or structural changes, was 61.7% and 53.8% in the B-ALL and T-ALL patients, respectively. Hyperdiploidy was the most common (32%) cytogenetic abnormality. Among structural abnormalities, the most common was t(9;22) in 11% of the patients. The children showed a higher incidence of hyperdiploidy and lower incidence of t(9;22) than adults [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838981/). FISH can be used to probe for specific suspected abnormalities.

### Cell Markers and Flow Cytometry

* Immature markers (blasts)
    * CD34 – Most specific blast marker
    * CD117 – Typically myeloid blasts
    * TdT – Typically lymphoid blasts
* Myeloid markers
    * MPO (myeloperoxidase) – Most specific myeloid marker
    * CD13
    * CD33
* Lymphoid markers
    * B cell: CD19, CD20, CD79a, surface light chain (kappa, lambda)
    * T cell: CD3 (most specific), CD7, CD2, CD5, CD4, CD8

# Treatment

- **Dasatinib**: Oral short acting ABL/SRC tyrosine kinase, often used for CML and Ph+ ALL which are characterized by constitutively active tyrosine kinase.  Side effects
of dasatinib are frequent but mostly moderate and manageable and include cytopenias and pleural effusions. Preclinical studies suggest that dasatinib induces apoptosis in only a small subset of cell lines. Inhibition of migration, invasion, and cell adhesion by dasatinib is reported more frequently. [[ref]](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-54490-3_2.pdf)

### PADV Regimen
- **Prednisone**: synthetic, anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid that derives from cortisone. It is biologically inert and converted to prednisolone in the liver. Prednisone is an FDA-approved, delayed-release corticosteroid indicated as an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agent to treat a broad range of diseases, including immunosuppressive/endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic states, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal (GI, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and as an anti-inflammatory and an antineoplastic agent.) After cell surface receptor attachment and entry into the cell, prednisone enters the nucleus, binds, and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production. This agent decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, inducing cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell populations. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534809/)
- **Asparaginase**: Anti-ALL agent. The anti-leukemic effect of asparaginase is due to the fact that lymphoblastic leukemia cells are unable to synthesize adequate amounts of L-asparagine (Asn) and, therefore, depend on extracellular sources. Asparaginase catalyzes the conversion of Asn to aspartic acid and ammonia, thereby depleting serum Asn and starving leukemic cells of the Asn necessary for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, leading ultimately to cell death. Up to 30% of patients may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to E. Coli. derived aspariginase and must be switched to _Erwinia_ derived asparaginase. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936081/)
- **Daunorubicin**: Daunorubicin is an anti-neoplastic agent that has approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a remission induction therapy along with another cytotoxic agent in acute non-lymphocytic leukemias including acute myelogenous, promyelocytic, and erythroid leukemias in adults and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in both children and adults. In adult ALL, daunorubicin significantly increases the rate of complete remission from 47% to 83% when added to the triple therapy with vincristine, prednisone, and L asparaginase. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142552/)
    - Daunorubicin is a member of the anthracycline class of antibiotics. It exerts its anti-neoplastic properties through various mechanisms that include both anti-mitotic and anti-cytotoxic activities. It acts by intercalating between the DNA base pairs, causing the DNA double helix to uncoil and inhibit the topoisomerase II enzyme, resulting in single and double-strand breaks, thus inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis.
    - Daunorubicin also inhibits polymerase enzyme activity, dysregulating the gene expression and resulting in free radical damage to the DNA and ultimately resulting in apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and programmed cell death. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559073/)
- **Vincristine**: Vincristine belongs to the category of vinca alkaloids, a class of drugs that function by impeding the proper division of cancer cells. This drug inhibits cell growth by disrupting mitosis by interfering with microtubule polymerization. Other effects include inhibition of mitotic spindle formation which arrest the cell cycle at metaphase, inducing apoptosis.
    - Vincristine holds FDA approval for the treatment of several malignancies, including ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, B-cell ALL, lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
    - Adverse effects include neurotoxicity, myelosupression, alopecia, GI toxicity, and extravasation due to the vesicant nature of vincristine. If the IV is placed incorrectly, hyaluronidase antidote must be administered immediatley. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537122/)

### Methotrexate

In cancer, methotrexate acts as an antifolate antimetabolite. Methotrexate is taken up into the cell by carriers called the human reduced folate carriers (SLC19A1), and it forms methotrexate-polyglutamate. Both the methotrexate and the methotrexate-polyglutamate inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid. Tetrahydrofolate is necessary for the synthesis of the nucleotides of both DNA and RNA. Methotrexate-polyglutamate further inhibits the de novo purine synthesis of both purine and thymidylate synthase, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Even a low dose of methotrexate is not free from side effects. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, mucosal ulcers, and loss of appetite. These are noted in most of the patients and are easily managed. The major adverse effect of methotrexate is hepatotoxicity. These side effects are similar to folate deficiency and can be prevented by supplementation of methotrexate with folic acid. Alopecia, fatigue, fever, increased risk of infection, low white cell count, GI bleeding, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression (aplastic anemia), malignancy (lymphoproliferative disorders), infections, and renal failure are other potentially life-threatening side effects.

When given intrathecally, it prevents leukaemia cells entering the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spine and brain. It is also used to treat leukaemia found in the CSF. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556114/)

### Therapy-related AML

Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is a recognized clinical syndrome occurring as a complication after cytotoxic and/or radiation therapy. At present, approximately 10% of all AMLs arise after a patient's exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation for a primary malignancy or autoimmune disease. The outcomes of t-AML are worse than de-novo AML. The treatment most likley to cure t-AML is allogenic HCT. 

The most common subtype, occurring after exposure to alkylating agents and/or radiation with a latency period of 5-10 years, is frequently accompanied by unbalanced cytogenetic abnormalities, such as loss of all or parts of chromosomes 5 and/or 7. The second less common subtype, arising after treatment with agents targeting topoisomerase II, has shorter latency period of 1-5 years and frequently exhibits balanced chromosomal rearrangements involving MLL, RUNX1, and PML-RARA. [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/117/7/2137/28218/The-impact-of-therapy-related-acute-myeloid)

Deletions or losses in chromosomes 5 or 7 are recurrent non-random abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and are associated with prior exposure to carcinogens or leukemogenic agents, and with poor prognosis. These deletions may also occur in ALL, but are not predictive of worse prognosis. 

#### PARP inhibitors

**Olaparib (PARP Inhibitors)**: PARP (PolyADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitors have significant clinical benefits in patients with ovarian cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer, especially in BRCA1/2 associated cancers. PARP is a family of proteins which are involved in SSB DNA repair. Inhibition of PARP can lead to tumor cell death via _synthetic lethality_ in which the combination of two non-lethal conditions causes cell death. This is advantageous as it theoretically limits cell death to cells expressing the first co-lethal factor (i.e. BRCA1/2 inhibition of DSB DNA repair via homologous recombination). [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4013421/). PARP inhibitors are associated with MDS and AML toxicity, and the potential associations of olaparib were stronger. The IC (a measure of association in Baysean confidence propagation neural networks) for PARP inhibitors for AML was 4.83 and for MDS was 5.27. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9240214/)

## Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Transplants can be autologus (self-cells) or allogenic (HLA matched cells from another individual)

- **Preparative Regimens** [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation)
    * Myeloablative – A myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and results in profound pancytopenia within one to three weeks from the time of administration. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting and usually irreversible unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. Examples include total body irradiation ≥5 Gy in a single dose or busulfan >8 mg/kg. (See 'Myeloablative regimens' below.)
    * Nonmyeloablative – A nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimen is one that will cause minimal cytopenia (but significant lymphopenia) by itself and may not require stem cell support. Examples include fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide with or without antithymocyte globulin or total body irradiation ≤2 Gy with or without a purine analog. However, the transplant, when given in this setting, usually becomes myeloablative because the engrafting donor T cells will eventually eliminate host hematopoietic cells, allowing the establishment of donor hematopoiesis. (See 'NMA and RIC regimens' below.)
    * Reduced intensity – Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are an intermediate category of regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Such regimens cause cytopenias, which may be prolonged and result in significant morbidity and mortality and require hematopoietic stem cell support. Regimens generally considered as reduced intensity include ≤8 mg/kg of busulfan, or ≤140 mg/m2 of melphalan.
- **MOA**: stem cells are extracted via a series of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirations and cultured. These cells are then injected back into the patient, typically via a central line, following myeloablative chemo/radiation therapy. The cells then re-colonize the obliterated bone marrow.
- **Indication**
    - Allogenic tranplantation is indicated for post-remission therapy for patients in first or subsequent remission of AML, ALL. Initial therapy in MDS. For patients refractory to treatment for CLL or following blast crisis in CML following TKI induction. 
- **Complications**
    - Pre-engraftment: neutropenic fever, mucositis, diarrhea, pneumonia, catherter-associated cellulitis, bloodstream infection, hepatitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis are possible. Most are due to increased succeptibility to infection by new or reactivated bacteria and viruses or adverse reactions to preconditioning regimines. 
    - Early post-engraftment: Pneumonia, diarrhea, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and encephalitis due to reactivation of latent viral infections or early manifestations of graft vs. host disease (GVHD).
    - Late post-engraftment: Infectious complications may occur, especially in the case of extensive GVHD
- **GVHD**: immunocompetent T-lymphocytes in the graft attack imunodeficient recipient tissue. Only occurs in allogenic transplants and the risk can be reduced via HLA matching as extensivley as possible. 
    * Phase 1 (afferent phase): Radiation or chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation causes recipient tissue damage. This leads to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF alpha) and expression of MHC antigens that enhance APCs (antigen-presenting cells) to present alloantigens to the donor T cells.
    * Phase 2 (efferent phase): This phase is characterized by the interaction of donor T cells with host APCs that proliferate and differentiate into activated T cells which then release additional inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, INF-γ).
    * Phase 3 (effector phase): The third phase is characterized by the migration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells migrate to target organs and cause tissue damage leading to multiorgan failure. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538235/)
- **GVHD Staging** [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538235/)
    * Skin     
        * Stage 1: Maculopapular rash less than 25% of the body
        * Stage 2: Maculopapular rash 25% to 50% of the body

        * (D) Life-threatening: stage 4 skin, liver, or GI involvement

### Followup

![Followup ALL](/img/ALL_followup.png)


### Note on MDS and AML

AML is characterized by a block in hematopoietic cell maturation, leading to an accumulation of myeloblasts in the blood or bone marrow (≥20% of nucleated cells). In contrast, MDS patients produce mature blood cells, although maturation and cell morphology are abnormal, and mature cells are reduced in number. Although the block in maturation is a continuum between MDS and secondary AML, higher blast percentage generally confers a worse prognosis in MDS.
* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (**ALL**): ALL is seen in patients with the blastic transformation of B and T cells. It is the most common leukemia in the pediatric population, accounting for up to 80% of cases in this group vs. 20% of cases in adults. Treatment among adolescents and young adults is predominantly inspired by pediatric regimens with better survival rates.  
* Acute myelogenous leukemia (**AML**): AML is characterized by greater than 20% myeloid blasts and is the most common acute leukemia in adults. It is the most aggressive cancer with a variable prognosis depending upon the molecular subtypes. [[refs 1, ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560490/)[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7332895/)]

### SDoH


    Blacks and Hispanics have up to a 12% and 17% higher risk of mortality from childhood leukemias than non-Hispanic whites respectively. According to a study in 2000 comparing mortality rates in black and Hispanic children, part of mortality disparities was attributable to biological prognostic markers, such as a B-precursor, which were more found more in blacks and Hispanics. Researchers also found differences in chemotherapy drug metabolism based on race and ethnicity, especially in relation to chemotherapy drugs MTX and 6-MP. This suggests a significant biological component in racial disparities in mortality of childhood leukemias.

    Non-adherence to treatment also plays a significant role in racial disparities in childhood leukemias mortality. In a study of ALL patients undergoing home therapy with mercaptopurine, researchers found Hispanic children were more likely than non-Hispanic white children to skip doses of mercaptopurine, resulting in a lower survival. A possible reason for this is a language barrier, which can decrease understanding of the disease and result in non-adherence.

    Language difference also plays a part in mortality rates in East Asian patients. A 2012 study found significantly poorer ALL survival rates in East Asian children compared to non-Hispanic whites. However, East Asians are comparable to non-Hispanic whites in socioeconomic status and education. Because of this, researchers suggested language difference as a significant factor in survival rates. Overall, both biological and behavioral differences seem to explain racial disparities independent of socioeconomic status in prognosis, relapse, and mortality of childhood leukemias.
