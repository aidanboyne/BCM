# Gene Mutations

- **Translocation:**
  - *Definition:* Translocation refers to the movement of a chromosomal segment from one location to another within a genome.
  - Ex. t(9;22), or the Philidelphia chromosome, is classic for CML.  t(14;18) is common in follicular lymphoma and may also occur in other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The t(15;17) translocation that generates the PML/RARA is classic in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) which is associated with coagulopathy.
  - Chromosomal translocations originate from double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are brought into proximity in the nuclear space and joined inappropriately by DNA-repair pathway [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124105249000025).
- **Missense Mutation:**
  - *Definition:* A missense mutation is a genetic alteration that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in a protein sequence.
  - *Clinical Significance:* Depending on the affected protein, missense mutations can lead to functional changes, potentially causing diseases or influencing traits.
- **Nonsense Mutation:**
  - *Definition:* Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon in a gene sequence, leading to truncation of the resulting protein.
  - *Clinical Significance:* Nonsense mutations often result in nonfunctional or truncated proteins, contributing to genetic disorders.
- **Deletion:**
  - *Definition:* Deletion involves the removal or loss of a segment of DNA from a chromosome.
  - *Clinical Significance:* Deletions can disrupt gene function, leading to genetic disorders. **Cytogenic deletion** specifically refers to the visible loss of a chromosomal segment or entire chromosome under a microscope, often associated with syndromes and developmental abnormalities.

## Leukemia Genes

- **FLT3**: receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by immature hematopoietic cells [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/100/5/1532/106333/The-roles-of-FLT3-in-hematopoiesis-and-leukemia). Mutations of FLT3 (most often small tandem duplications in juxtamembrane domain) have been detected in about 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and a small number of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and cause constituative activity. Indicative of poor prgnosis. 
- **K-RAS**: codes for a protein called K-Ras that is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, consisting of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, regulates genes that control cellular development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. [[ref]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/20/5059)
	- KRAS has been deemed a challenging therapeutic target, even “undruggable”, after drug-targeting efforts over the past four decades. Recently, there have been surprising advances in directly targeted drugs for KRAS, especially in KRAS (G12C) inhibitors, such as AMG510 (sotorasib) and MRTX849 (adagrasib), which have obtained encouraging results in clinical trials. AMG510 was the first drug-targeting KRAS (G12C) to be approved for clinical use this year. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00780-4)
- **DNMT3A**: DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) belongs to a family of highly conserved DNA methyltransferases that catalyse 5-methylcytosine methylation. Regulatory domains of DNMT3A allow interactions with histone methyltransferases and histones to influence gene expression. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc3895.pdf)
    ![DNMT3A mutation frequency](/img/DNMT3A.PNG)
- **SET D2:** Histone methyltransferase SETD2, the sole human gene responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity and stability by several distinct pathways. SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair, and depletion of SETD2 shows MSI and an increased spontaneous mutation frequency. SETD2 also provides an alternative mechanism that leads to DNA damage repair through interacting with p53 tumor suppressor. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-021-00193-0)
    ![SETD2](/img/SETD2.png)
- **PTEN:** Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog deleted on Chr. 10 is a dual phosphatase that reduces the levels of PIP3, inhibiting the activation of the PI3K pathway such as AKT and PKC, both of which promote cell growth and survival. [[ref]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00338/full) Congential lack of PTEN can cause diffuse hamartomas
- **JAK 1:** Janus Kinase 1 is a human tyrosine kinase protein essential for signaling for certain type I and type II cytokines. It creates  docking sites for signal transducers and activators of trasnscription (STATs) as part of the JAK-STAT activation pathway. It has been correlated with AML, but JAK2 is more commonly associated with myeloproliferative diseases. [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/111/9/4809/24511/Identification-of-somatic-JAK1-mutations-in)
- **TP53**: Tumor protein 53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer and regulates metabolic functions, apoptotic pathways, cellular sensecence, and DNA repair. TP53 mutations are seen in 5–10% of de novo MDS and AML, but 25–40% of therapy-related MDS and AML. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9496940/)

# Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is the most common childhood malignancy. The term ALL/LBL is used because the current system for diagnosis and classification does not distinguish between clinical presentations as leukemia or lymphoma, accounting for about 1/3 of all childhood cancer.

## Diagnosis

- Hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly are the most common clinical findings
- Lymphadenopathy
- Fever
- Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and abnormal WBC counts
- MSK pain
- Mediastinal mass (more associated with T-ALL/LBL) with accompanying mass effect is rare but possible

# Treatment

- **Dasatinib**: Oral short acting ABL/SRC tyrosine kinase, often used for CML and Ph+ ALL which are characterized by constitutively active tyrosine kinase.  Side effects
of dasatinib are frequent but mostly moderate and manageable and include cytopenias and pleural effusions. Preclinical studies suggest that dasatinib induces apoptosis in only a small
subset of cell lines. Inhibition of migration, invasion, and cell adhesion by dasatinib is reported more frequently. [[ref]](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-54490-3_2.pdf)

### PADV RegimenI
- **Prednisone**: synthetic, anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid that derives from cortisone. It is biologically inert and converted to prednisolone in the liver. Prednisone is an FDA-approved, delayed-release corticosteroid indicated as an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agent to treat a broad range of diseases, including immunosuppressive/endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic states, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal (GI, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and as an anti-inflammatory and an antineoplastic agent.) After cell surface receptor attachment and entry into the cell, prednisone enters the nucleus, binds, and activates specific nuclear receptors, resulting in altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production. This agent decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, inducing cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell populations. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534809/)
- **Asparaginase**: Anti-ALL agent. The anti-leukemic effect of asparaginase is due to the fact that lymphoblastic leukemia cells are unable to synthesize adequate amounts of L-asparagine (Asn) and, therefore, depend on extracellular sources. Asparaginase catalyzes the conversion of Asn to aspartic acid and ammonia, thereby depleting serum Asn and starving leukemic cells of the Asn necessary for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, leading ultimately to cell death. Up to 30% of patients may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to E. Coli. derived aspariginase and must be switched to _Erwinia_ derived asparaginase. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936081/)
- **Daunorubicin**: Daunorubicin is an anti-neoplastic agent that has approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a remission induction therapy along with another cytotoxic agent in acute non-lymphocytic leukemias including acute myelogenous, promyelocytic, and erythroid leukemias in adults and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in both children and adults. In adult ALL, daunorubicin significantly increases the rate of complete remission from 47% to 83% when added to the triple therapy with vincristine, prednisone, and L asparaginase. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142552/)
    - Daunorubicin is a member of the anthracycline class of antibiotics. It exerts its anti-neoplastic properties through various mechanisms that include both anti-mitotic and anti-cytotoxic activities. It acts by intercalating between the DNA base pairs, causing the DNA double helix to uncoil and inhibit the topoisomerase II enzyme, resulting in single and double-strand breaks, thus inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis.
    - Daunorubicin also inhibits polymerase enzyme activity, dysregulating the gene expression and resulting in free radical damage to the DNA and ultimately resulting in apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and programmed cell death. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559073/)
- **Vincristine**: Vincristine belongs to the category of vinca alkaloids, a class of drugs that function by impeding the proper division of cancer cells. This drug inhibits cell growth by disrupting mitosis by interfering with microtubule polymerization. Other effects include inhibition of mitotic spindle formation which arrest the cell cycle at metaphase, inducing apoptosis.
    - Vincristine holds FDA approval for the treatment of several malignancies, including ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, B-cell ALL, lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
    - Adverse effects include neurotoxicity, myelosupression, alopecia, GI toxicity, and extravasation due to the vesicant nature of vincristine. If the IV is placed incorrectly, hyaluronidase antidote must be administered immediatley. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537122/)

### Methotrexate

In cancer, methotrexate acts as an antifolate antimetabolite. Methotrexate is taken up into the cell by carriers called the human reduced folate carriers (SLC19A1), and it forms methotrexate-polyglutamate. Both the methotrexate and the methotrexate-polyglutamate inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid. Tetrahydrofolate is necessary for the synthesis of the nucleotides of both DNA and RNA. Methotrexate-polyglutamate further inhibits the de novo purine synthesis of both purine and thymidylate synthase, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Even a low dose of methotrexate is not free from side effects. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, mucosal ulcers, and loss of appetite. These are noted in most of the patients and are easily managed. The major adverse effect of methotrexate is hepatotoxicity. These side effects are similar to folate deficiency and can be prevented by supplementation of methotrexate with folic acid. Alopecia, fatigue, fever, increased risk of infection, low white cell count, GI bleeding, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression (aplastic anemia), malignancy (lymphoproliferative disorders), infections, and renal failure are other potentially life-threatening side effects.

When given intrathecally, it prevents leukaemia cells entering the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spine and brain. It is also used to treat leukaemia found in the CSF. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556114/)

## Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Transplants can be autologus (self-cells) or allogenic (HLA matched cells from another individual)

- **Preparative Regimens** [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation)
    * Myeloablative – A myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and results in profound pancytopenia within one to three weeks from the time of administration. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting and usually irreversible unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. Examples include total body irradiation ≥5 Gy in a single dose or busulfan >8 mg/kg. (See 'Myeloablative regimens' below.)
    * Nonmyeloablative – A nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimen is one that will cause minimal cytopenia (but significant lymphopenia) by itself and may not require stem cell support. Examples include fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide with or without antithymocyte globulin or total body irradiation ≤2 Gy with or without a purine analog. However, the transplant, when given in this setting, usually becomes myeloablative because the engrafting donor T cells will eventually eliminate host hematopoietic cells, allowing the establishment of donor hematopoiesis. (See 'NMA and RIC regimens' below.)
    * Reduced intensity – Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are an intermediate category of regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Such regimens cause cytopenias, which may be prolonged and result in significant morbidity and mortality and require hematopoietic stem cell support. Regimens generally considered as reduced intensity include ≤8 mg/kg of busulfan, or ≤140 mg/m2 of melphalan.

- **MOA**
- **Indication**
    - Allogenic tranplantation is indicated for post-remission therapy for patients in first or subsequent remission of AML, ALL. Initial therapy in MDS. For patients refractory to treatment for CLL or following blast crisis in CML following TKI induction. 

- **Complications**
    - Pre-engraftment: neutropenic fever, mucositis, diarrhea, pneumonia, catherter-associated cellulitis, bloodstream infection, hepatitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis are possible. Most are due to increased succeptibility to infection by new or reactivated bacteria and viruses or adverse reactions to preconditioning regimines. 
    - Early post-engraftment: Pneumonia, diarrhea, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and encephalitis due to reactivation of latent viral infections or early manifestations of graft vs. host disease (GVHD).
    - Late post-engraftment: Infectious complications may occur, especially in the case of extensive GVHD
- **GVHD**: immunocompetent T-lymphocytes in the graft attack imunodeficient recipient tissue. Only occurs in allogenic transplants and the risk can be reduced via HLA matching as extensivley as possible. 
    * Phase 1 (afferent phase): Radiation or chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation causes recipient tissue damage. This leads to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF alpha) and expression of MHC antigens that enhance APCs (antigen-presenting cells) to present alloantigens to the donor T cells.
    * Phase 2 (efferent phase): This phase is characterized by the interaction of donor T cells with host APCs that proliferate and differentiate into activated T cells which then release additional inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, INF-γ).
    * Phase 3 (effector phase): The third phase is characterized by the migration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells migrate to target organs and cause tissue damage leading to multiorgan failure. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538235/)
- **GVHD Staging**
    * Skin     
        * Stage 1: Maculopapular rash less than 25% of the body
        * Stage 2: Maculopapular rash 25% to 50% of the body

### Followup

![Followup ALL](/img/ALL_followup.png)


SDoH


    Blacks and Hispanics have up to a 12% and 17% higher risk of mortality from childhood leukemias than non-Hispanic whites respectively. According to a study in 2000 comparing mortality rates in black and Hispanic children, part of mortality disparities was attributable to biological prognostic markers, such as a B-precursor, which were more found more in blacks and Hispanics. Researchers also found differences in chemotherapy drug metabolism based on race and ethnicity, especially in relation to chemotherapy drugs MTX and 6-MP. This suggests a significant biological component in racial disparities in mortality of childhood leukemias.

    Non-adherence to treatment also plays a significant role in racial disparities in childhood leukemias mortality. In a study of ALL patients undergoing home therapy with mercaptopurine, researchers found Hispanic children were more likely than non-Hispanic white children to skip doses of mercaptopurine, resulting in a lower survival. A possible reason for this is a language barrier, which can decrease understanding of the disease and result in non-adherence.

    Language difference also plays a part in mortality rates in East Asian patients. A 2012 study found significantly poorer ALL survival rates in East Asian children compared to non-Hispanic whites. However, East Asians are comparable to non-Hispanic whites in socioeconomic status and education. Because of this, researchers suggested language difference as a significant factor in survival rates. Overall, both biological and behavioral differences seem to explain racial disparities independent of socioeconomic status in prognosis, relapse, and mortality of childhood leukemias.
