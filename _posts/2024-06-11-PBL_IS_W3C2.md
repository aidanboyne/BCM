## Oppurtunistic Infections in HIV

### CD4+ <250 cells/mm3
- Coccidiomycosis [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16163637/): primarily in the southwestern US and california. Presents with diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates, dyspnea, fever, and night sweats. Disseminated disease includes lymphadenitis, meningitis, and cutaneous lesions. Culture is useful for diagnosis. Treatment is liposomal amphotericin B. Itraconazole can treat uncomplicated infections. 
    - Dimorphic saprophytic fungus. Common cause of CAP in endemic regions. 
- Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Twelve weeks of once-weekly isonaizid and rifapentine (3HP), given by self-administered therapy or directly observed therapy, is the newest CDC-recommended treatment regimen for persons with latent TB infection and HIV and who are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine. Active infection should be treated with 4-month high dose rifapentine, moxifloxicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide combination treatment. See more TB details in the [previous case](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/posts/PBL_IS_W3C1/)

### CD4+ <200 cells/mm3
- Pneumocystis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132788/): Classically, HIV-associated PCP presents with fevers, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. Symptoms may be subtle at first but gradually progress and may be present for several weeks before diagnosis. CXR usually demonstrates bilateral symetric reticulogranular opacities. Bronchoscopy with BAL is gold standard for diagnosis, but there are some PCR and serum tests available. Treat with TMP-SMX. PPX is indicated for CD4+ <200. 
- Oropharyngeal/esophagial Candida [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-candidiasis-in-adults_): symptoms include a cottony feeling in the mouth, loss of taste, and, in some cases, pain during eating and swallowing. Physical exam demonstrates pseudomembranous lesions, or nonspecific erythema. Plaques in thrush are distinguished from oral hairy leukoplakia and lichen planus by their ability to be scraped off (usually causes some pinpoint bleeds). Laryngeal candidiasis may be suspected in a patient with evidence of oropharyngeal infection who presents with hoarseness. The hallmark of esophageal candidiasis is pain or difficulty with swallowing. Patients usually localize their pain to a discrete retrosternal area. The absence of thrush does not preclude the diagnosis of esophagitis. 
    - Oral thrush can be treated with topical clotrimazole troches, miconazole buccal tablets, or nystatin swish and swallow. Severe infection is treated with systemic fluconazole. Recurrent disease can be treated with fluconazole. 
    - Candida esophagitis must be treated with systemic antifungals. Fluconazole is the drug of choice. 

### CD4+ <150 cells/mm3
- Histoplasmosis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090190/): endemic mycosis, caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It is a dimorphic fungus that displays different morphologies depending on environmental conditions: a mold in the soil and a budding yeast in the mammalian host. The mold (saprophytic form) grows best in soils with a high nitrogen content associated with the presence of bird and bat guano. Demolition, construction, farming, raising chickens, archaeological digging and spelunking have been associated with an increased risk of infection.
    - Primarily in Ohio and Mississippi River valleys
    - Infected macrophages induce granuloma formation. However, macrophages from HIV-infected individuals do not mount an effective immune response.
    - Most AIDS patients with CD4 counts <150 cells/µL present with disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) when infected. Fever, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and respiratory symptoms are common. Culture, antigen detection, and serology are diagnosis options.
    - Liposomal amphotericin B should be used in patients who are sufficiently ill to require hospitalization (inclding meningitis). Less severe infections can be treated with itraconazole. 
    - Lifelong suppressive therapy with itraconazole 200 mg/day was recommended if immunosuppression could not be reversed or if histoplasmosis relapsed despite an appropriate treatment.

### CD4+ <100 cells/mm3
- Toxoplasma [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441877/): Most common CNS infection in AIDS patients not on appropriate prophylaxis. Usually manifests with multiple CNS masses. 
    - Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite associated with cat feces. Symptoms arise over a few days to a month and include headache, confusion, and lethargy. Global encephalitis may result in untreated disease. 
    - Diagnosis is made with CD4 count, compatible clinical history, IgG antibody, and MRI with typical ring-enhancing lesions. Can be confirmed (but not too sensitive) with CSF PCR.
    - Differential should include CNS lymphoma, TB, Cryptococcus, neurosyphilis, CMV, and stroke.
    - Treatment includes pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Leucovorin should be administered to prevent pyrimethamine induced hematologic toxicity. Primary therapy is given for 6 weeks followed by long term supressive therapy and HAART to restore CD4+ counts.
- Cryptococcus [[ref]](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-pediatric-opportunistic-infections/cryptococcosis): Cryptococcosis often presents with subtle and non-specific findings, such as fever and headache. Early diagnosis requires consideration of this infection in symptomatic patients whose CD4 counts indicate severe immunosuppression. In both HIV-infected adults and children, meningoencephalitis is the most common initial manifestation of cryptococcosis. The disease typically evolves over days to weeks with fever and headache. Less frequent findings include nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and focal neurologic signs
    - LP should be conducted in any suspected cryptococcal meningitis. Opening pressure is typically evelevated, though all other metrics may be normal. Culture cinches the diagnosis.  
    - Combination therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate (or liposomal amphotericin B) and flucytosine for 2 weeks (induction therapy) followed by fluconazole for a minimum of 8 weeks (consolidation therapy) is recommended for central nervous system disease 
- CMV retinits [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10100416/): Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is responsible for the most common viral opportunistic infection in persons with acquired immunodeficiency virus syndrome (AIDS). Clinical disease due to CMV has been recognized in up to 40% of patients with advanced HIV disease. The most common presentation is retinitis, although colitis, esophagitis, pneumonitis and neurological disorders are also reported frequently. CMV retinitis is usually diagnosed clinically, and serological testing for CMV immunoglobulin is useful to support the diagnosis.
    - CMV retinitis is a full thickness retinal infection that can lead to necrosis with retinal tear and detachment. It is a dsDNA virus in herpesviridae family.
        ![CMV retinitis](/img/CMV_retinitis.jpeg)
    - Most patients are asymptomatic, but may have floaters, flashes (photopsias), blind spots (scotomata). Pain and photophobia are uncommon.
    - Physical exam shows yellow white retinal lesions that often start in the periphery and follow the vasculature centripetally. However, it can start in the posterior segment. The classic findings are retinal hemorrhages with a whitish, granular appearance to the retina. Each lesion has the most activity in the borders. Vitreous signs of inflammation may be minimal as most patients are severely immunosuppressed. Very early CMV may resemble cotton wool spots, but with lesions larger than 750 µm, CMV must be considered. 
    - Treatment is HAART and valganciclovir/ganciclovir

### CD4+ <50 cells/mm3
- Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-persons-with-hiv): Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) refers to infections caused by one of two nontuberculous mycobacterial species, either M. avium or M. intracellulare. The two principal forms of MAC infection in patients with HIV are disseminated disease and focal lymphadenitis. It is trasnmitted via inhalation or ingestion. 
    - Disseminated disease: fever, night sweats, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 
    - Lymphadenitis: fever, leukocytosis, and focal lymphadenitis. Usually due to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
- PML [[ref]](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy): John Cunningham virus (JCV), the etiological agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), contains a hyper-variable non-coding control region usually detected in urine of healthy individuals as archetype form and in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PML patients as rearranged form. 
    - Symptoms include altered mental status, motor deficits, limb and gait ataxia, visual symptoms (diplopia, hemianopia), and seizures.
    - Treatment includes HAART and high-dose seteroids if developing as part of IRIS.  
- Bartonella (Bacillary angiomatosis/peliosis hepatits) [[ref]](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/bacillary-angiomatosis): Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella (Rochalimaea) quintana and Bartonella (Rochalimaea) henselae, gram-negative intracellular bacteria. Cats are the main reservoir for B henselae, and humans for B quintana. Although the infection may be spread via cat bites and scratches, fleas are the major route of transmission. B quintana is transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus) and fleas.
    - The disease manifests as many easily bleeding papules and nodules. High fever, lymphadenitis, nausea, vomiting, sweats, and anorexia may develop. 
    - Treated with Erythromycin or doxy for 3-6mo.
    ![Bacillary Angiomatosis](/img/bac_angiomatosis.png)
- Primary CNS lymphoma [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29604975/): The majority of cases are EBV realted.Neurologic symptoms can be headache, cognitive function disorders, focal neurologic, deficit and epilepsy. Differential diagnosis includes other oncologic or infectious causes, with cerebral toxoplasmosis being the most important. Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, activity on 201thallium single-photon emission computed tomography, presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, and toxoplasmosis serology can make either PCNSL or cerebral toxoplasmosis more or less likely.
    - Poor prognosis (2-4mo, or 1.5 years with treatment)
    - Caused by **B-cells**
    - Treatment includes high-dose methotrexate based chemo +/- rituximab. 
- HHV-8 (Kaposi's Sarcoma) [[ref]](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/kaposi-sarcoma): Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a disease of the endothelial cells of blood vessels and the lymphatic system. Despite its name, it is no longer classified as a sarcoma (which is a malignant tumour of mesenchymal origin) as it is due to multicentric vascular hyperplasia.
    - Classical type affects old men of the Mediterranean, central eruope, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Not associated with HIV
    - HIV associated has a more agressive course and pressents as flat patches on the legs that evolve into plaques and scaly tumors. These can also occur in the gut, lungs, genitals, lymphatic system, and elsewhere causing dysphagia, bleeding, hematemisis, hematochezia or melana, and edema. 
    ![Kaposi](/img/classic_kaposi.png)

Generally, HIV patients are at greatly enhanced risk of certain malignancies (Kaposi = 50k risk, NHL = 100x, Burkitt = 60 fold, CNS lympoma 5000 fold, and cervical cancer 8 fold).

Some other viruses that are more problematic in patients with unconrtrolled HIV include:
- VZV: vesicobullous lesions not necissarily confined to a single dermitome. Persistent hyperkeratotic or necrotic skin lesions, post-herpetic neuralgia, other neurological events, ocular events and pneumonitis occurring within 6 months of the onset of the last episode of VZV are common complications.
- HSV-1/2: Co-infection with HSV-2 increases shed of HIV virus in untreated patients, increasing infectivity. HIV also increases load of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 increasing the recurrence of lesions and promiting disseminated disease which may present as HSV encephalitis which disproportionatly affects the temporal lobe. Myelitis is also possible (more associated with HSV-2)
- Syphilis [[ref]](https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/syphilis-hiv.htm): Persons with HIV infection who have early syphilis might be at increased risk for neurologic complications and might have higher rates of inadequate serologic response with recommended regimens.

### Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome

IRIS is a state of dysregulated, hyper-inflammatory response against opportunistic infections that usually occurs in the first six months of treatment of HIV/AIDS patients with HAART. It is also seen in SOT patients, postpartum patients, neutropenic patients, and after discontinuation of TNF antagonists.

The most frequently encountered adverse effect of HAART includes nausea, lethargy, cold, loss of taste sensation, anxiety, anorexia, depression, peripheral neuropathy. Other potential side-effects include anemia, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, lipodystrophy, specifically noted with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PIs) use. IRIS is an independent complication associated with response against latent **CMV, mycobacterium, cryptococcus, EBV, PJP, JC, and HepB/C** infections. 

Specific IRIS symptoms depend on the organism against which the renewed immune system is responding. Generally, treatment of the underlying infections and in some cases, the addition of steroids can help control IRIS symptoms.

## Pharmacology

## Medications Overview

### Acetaminophen

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS and works peripherally to block pain impulse generation. It also has an antipyretic effect via its action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.

#### Side Effects
- Hepatotoxicity, especially in overdose
- Rare skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Renal tubular necrosis (with chronic use)

### Ibuprofen

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, leading to decreased formation of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever.

#### Side Effects
- Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia)
- Gastric ulcers and bleeding
- Renal impairment
- Increased risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke)

### Fluconazole (Indications)

#### Indications
- **Oral Candidiasis (oral plaques)**: Effective for the treatment of fungal infections such as oral thrush caused by Candida species.
- **Other Indications**: Vaginal candidiasis, systemic Candida infections, cryptococcal meningitis, prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients.

### Seizure Treatment Protocol

#### Order of Treatment
1. **Benzodiazepines** (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam)
2. **Two Antiepileptics** (e.g., levetiracetam, fosphenytoin)
3. **Intubation + Propofol Drip** (for refractory status epilepticus)

### Benzodiazepines

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA-A receptor, leading to increased neuronal inhibition and decreased excitability.

#### Side Effects
- Sedation and drowsiness
- Respiratory depression
- Dependence and withdrawal symptoms
- Cognitive impairment

### Levetiracetam

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Binds to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, inhibiting neurotransmitter release and reducing neuronal excitability.

#### Side Effects
- Somnolence
- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Behavioral changes (e.g., irritability, agitation)

### Fosphenytoin

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Prodrug of phenytoin; stabilizes neuronal membranes and decreases seizure activity by increasing efflux or decreasing influx of sodium ions across cell membranes in the motor cortex.

#### Side Effects
- Paresthesia and pruritus (especially in the groin area)
- Hypotension
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Nystagmus and ataxia

### IV Propofol

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Potentiates GABA-A receptor activity and blocks sodium channels, resulting in sedation, hypnosis, and anticonvulsant properties.

#### Side Effects
- Hypotension
- Respiratory depression
- Hypertriglyceridemia (with prolonged use)
- Propofol infusion syndrome (rare but serious)

### Toxoplasmosis Treatment

#### Pyrimethamine

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, interfering with tetrahydrofolic acid synthesis, which is necessary for protozoal nucleic acid synthesis.

#### Side Effects
- Bone marrow suppression (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
- Gastrointestinal upset
- Hypersensitivity reactions

#### Sulfadiazine

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, interfering with folic acid synthesis in the parasite.

#### Side Effects
- Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Crystalluria and renal impairment
- Hemolytic anemia (in patients with G6PD deficiency)
- Gastrointestinal disturbances

#### Folinic Acid

#### Mechanism of Action
- **MOA**: Provides a source of folate, helping to counteract the bone marrow suppression caused by pyrimethamine.

#### Side Effects
- Generally well-tolerated
- Rarely may cause gastrointestinal disturbances or allergic reactions

### HIV Testing and Informed Consent

![Reccomended Testing](/img/HIV_testing.jpg)

All patient and partner information are confidential, regardless of if the patient is tested confidentially or declines testing. At minimum, all staff providing medical services to patients, including HIV screening, are expected to maintain and demonstrate a high level of confidentiality regarding patient information and strictly adhere to the policies and procedures of their agencies.

Consent for routine, opt-out HIV screening must be obtained in accordance with Texas law, Health and Safety Code §81.105 and §81.106. Note routine HIV screening does not require a separate signed consent form to test for HIV; general consent and documentation of informed consent, either in writing or verbally, are sufficient. Patient consent is inferred unless the patient specifically declines the test. Minors who have the capacity to consent may also consent to HIV testing.
