## Cellular structure and function

- The **cell** is the fundamental unit of every living organism.
- **Cell membrane** (plasma membrane or plasmalemma) contains the cell contents and controls what enters and exits. It is made of a **phospholipid bilayer**.
  - **Phospholipids** have a hydrophilic "head" and a hydrophobic "tail".
  - The membrane is **semipermeable**, allowing certain molecules through using protein channels.
- The internal structure is supported by the **cytoskeleton**, made of proteins like microfilaments and microtubules.
- Inside the cell is **cytosol** and **organelles** forming the **cytoplasm**.
- The **nucleus** contains our genetic material (DNA).
  - **DNA** is tightly coiled around **histones** and forms **chromosomes**.
  - DNA is transcribed to **RNA**, which ribosomes use to produce **proteins**.
- **Ribosomes** are protein-making factories, converting mRNA to proteins through **translation**.
- **Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** is an organelle with two types:
  - **Rough ER**: with ribosomes, produces proteins.
  - **Smooth ER**: produces lipids and can detoxify chemicals or produce hormones.
- **Golgi apparatus** packages and distributes molecules in vesicles.
  - **Vesicles** can be transport, secretory, or specialized like **lysosomes**.
- **Mitochondria** are energy-generating organelles, conducting aerobic respiration to produce **ATP**.
  - Glucose undergoes **glycolysis** and then processes like the **Krebs cycle** in mitochondria.
  - Alternatively, mitochondria can burn fatty acids through **beta oxidation**.
- **Peroxisomes** modify long fatty acids for mitochondrial use, converting dangerous byproducts safely.

## Cell signaling

- Cells communicate using **chemical signals** which act on **receptors** on other cells.
  
- Signals are categorized based on distance:
  - **Autocrine signals**: Target the same cell.
  - **Paracrine signals**: Target nearby cells.
  - **Endocrine signals**: Target distant cells, examples include **hormones** and **cytokines**.
  
- **Signaling molecules** (ligands) can be:
  - **Hydrophobic**: Repel water, need **carrier proteins** to reach target cells and can cross cell membrane.
  - **Hydrophilic**: Stay in water, float freely to target cells but can't cross cell membrane.

- **Cell signaling pathway** stages:
  - **Reception**: Target cell's receptor binds to a ligand.
  - **Transduction**: The receptor activates intracellular molecules (second messengers).
  - **Response**: The cell reacts to the signal.

- **Transmembrane receptors** have three main classes:
  1. **G protein-coupled receptors**: Long proteins that activate intracellular **G proteins** (subunits: alpha, beta, gamma). G proteins use **GDP** (inactive) or **GTP** (active) and have types: **Gq, Gi, Gs**.
     - **Gq**: Activates **phospholipase C** which cleaves phospholipids, leading to calcium release and activation of **protein kinase C**.
     - **Gs**: Stimulates **adenylate cyclase** converting **ATP** to **cAMP**, which binds and activates **protein kinase A**.
     - **Gi**: Inhibits adenylate cyclase for negative feedback.
     
  2. **Enzyme-coupled receptors**: Single-pass transmembrane proteins with intrinsic enzyme activity.
     - **Receptor tyrosine kinases**: Most common, cross-phosphorylate upon ligand binding.
     - **Tyrosine kinase associated receptors**: Similar to above but without intrinsic enzyme activity.
     - **Receptor serine/threonine kinases**: Two classes (type I and II) that phosphorylate target proteins.
     
  3. **Ion channel receptors**: Open when a ligand binds, allowing ions to flow and change the cell's electric charge.

## Pharmacology Essentials

- **Pharmacology** is the study of how drugs or chemicals interact with living systems to produce effects.
  
- **Drug Development**:
  1. **Discovery**: Identification of a potential therapeutic compound.
  2. **Preclinical Research**: Testing on cell cultures and animals for safety.
  3. **Clinical Development**: Human trials in 4 phases:
     - **Phase I**: **Safety** assessment in a small group of healthy individuals.
     - **Phase II**: **Efficacy** determination in a moderately sized group with the condition.
     - **Phase III**: Comparison to standard treatments for **Approval** by regulatory bodies.
     - **Phase IV**: Monitoring for **Long term** or rare side effects post-market.
  
- **Drug Naming**:
  - **Chemical Name**: Describes its chemical structure.
  - **Generic Name**: Shortened version used by health professionals.
  - **Brand/Trade Name**: Given by pharmaceutical companies.

- **Pharmacokinetics (PK)**: What the body does to the drug, represented by **ADME**:
  - **Absorption**: Entry into the circulation.
  - **Distribution**: Movement to body tissues.
  - **Metabolism**: Chemical modification/breakdown.
  - **Excretion**: Removal from the body.

- **Pharmacodynamics (PD)**: What the drug does to the body.
  - Drugs bind to **receptors** triggering cellular changes.
  - Effects can be **therapeutic** (desired) or lead to **side effects** (unwanted).

- **Therapeutic Index (TI)**:
  - Ratio of toxic dose to effective dose.
  - A higher TI indicates a safer drug.
  - Medications with a low TI have a narrow safety margin and need close monitoring (e.g., warfarin, lithium).

- **Drug Interactions**:
  - **Pharmacokinetic Interactions**: One drug alters the ADME of another.
  - **Pharmacodynamic Interactions**: Drugs directly influence each other's effects, can be **synergistic** (combined effect greater than the sum of individual effects) or **antagonistic** (one drug opposes the effect of another).

## Drug administration and dosing

- **Routes of Administration**:
  1. **Enteral**: Medication is administered through the gastrointestinal tract.
     - **Peroral (Oral)**: Swallowed.
     - **Sublingual**: Placed under the tongue.
     - **Buccal**: Between the gums and inner cheek.
     - **Rectal**: Into the rectum.
  2. **Parenteral**: Bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.
     - **Intravenous (IV)**: Into a vein.
     - **Subcutaneous (SC)**: Under the skin.
     - **Intramuscular (IM)**: Into muscle.
  3. **Topical**: Applied on the skin or mucous membranes for local or systemic effect.

- **Factors influencing route choice**:
  - **Medication properties**: Stability, absorption capability.
  - **First-pass effect**: Medications extensively metabolized before reaching systemic circulation when administered orally.
  - **Bioavailability**: Portion of non-IV administered medication reaching systemic circulation. E.g., 60% bioavailability means 60% of the oral dose reaches circulation.

- **Dosing Regimens**:
  1. **Single Dosing**: One-time administration.
  2. **Continuous Infusion**: Constant rate IV administration.
     - **Steady State**: Dosing rate = Elimination rate.
     - Achieved in about 4-5 half-lives of the drug.
  3. **Intermittent Dosing**: Regular intervals of administration.
     - Fluctuating plasma concentration between peaks and troughs.
     - Steady state after 4 or 5 half-lives.

- **Dose Calculations**:
  - **Maintenance Dose**: Dose needed to maintain steady state.
    - Depends on clearance rate, bioavailability, and dosing interval.
  - **Loading Dose**: Initial large dose to rapidly reach desired plasma concentration.
    - Depends on volume of distribution (Vd) and bioavailability.

- **Volume of Distribution (Vd)**:
  - Indicates how widely a drug distributes in the body.
  - Small Vd: Remains in plasma. Large Vd: Widely distributed in the body.

- **Considerations for dosing**:
  - Individuals with decreased clearance (e.g., due to liver or renal disease) may need lower maintenance doses or extended dosing intervals.
  - Initial loading dose typically remains the same since Vd is not affected.

The route of administration is chosen based on medication properties and the clinical situation. Dosing regimens dictate how frequently and in what quantity a medication is given, with maintenance and loading doses determined by various pharmacokinetic parameters, ensuring both efficacy and safety.
