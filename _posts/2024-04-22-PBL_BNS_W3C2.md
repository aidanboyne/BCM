## Mental Status Exam

## Depression

The common feature of all depressive disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by related changes that significantly affect the individual’s capacity to function (e.g., somatic and cognitive changes in major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder). What differs among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology.

### Risk Factors

Heretibility is approximatley 40%, and first degree family members have 2-4x risk of developing MDD. Women experience MDD at approximatley 2x the rate of men, especially between menarche and menopause. Incidence peaks in the 20's. 

Multiple adverse childhood experiences along with several SDOH topics such as low income, low education, and discrimination are strongly associated with MDD. All non-mood disorders (such as anxiety, OCD, substance use) are risk factors.

### Major Depressive Disorder

The DSM5-TR criteria for MDD are as follows: 

Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight
gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.

These symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning and not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.

The symptoms must also not be a soley a response to a significant loss (e.g. bereavement, financial ruin, natural disaster, or disability). Noetheless, MDD can occur in addition to the normal response to such a loss. The episodes must not be due to schizophrenia or schizophreniform/schizoaffective, delusional, or other schizophrenic or psychotic disorders. There also must have **never** been a manic or hypomanic episode.

Severity of episodes can vary and should be specified. Presence of anxious, melancholic, atypical, or mood-congruent/incongruent psychotic features should be noted alongside catatonia, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern if applicable.  

#### Functional Alterations

Within the **salience network**, which is involved in detecting and assigning salience to emotional and motivational stimuli, people with MDD exhibit increased resting-state connectivity and heightened activation of the amygdala70, dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insula compared with healthy controls. By contrast, within the **frontoparietal network**, which is involved in several higher-order cognitive processes, including the control of goal-directed behaviour, people with MDD demonstrate hypoconnectivity at rest and in response to negative stimuli (such as viewing pictures designed to elicit disgust). Studies have also reported both hypo- and hyper-connectivity within the **default mode network** in people with MDD. This network of brain regions is involved in self-referential thinking, which may provide a neural explanation for the common presentation of rumination in MDD.

**HPA axis** dysregulation is also a major feature of MDD. Concentrations of cortisol in response to stressful stimuli are higher than healthy controls. 

#### Differential
- Bipolar I or Biploar II disorder: manic or hypomanic episodes must be exluded. 
    - A) Distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently goal-directed behavior or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary)
    - B) During the period, three or more of: inflated self-esteem/grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased talkitiveness/pressure, flight of ideas, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, excess involvement in activities with high potential for painful consequences
    - C) Impairment in social or occupational functioning or needing hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.
    - D) Not a result of another medical condition or a substance
- Substance/medication induced
- Persistent depressive disorder
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
- Schizoaffective disorder
- ADHD
- Adjustment disorder
- Superimposition on schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and other schizophria spectrum/psychotic disorders
- Bereavement
- Just sadness

#### Prognosis

MDD increases suicide risk by over 17x, especially when the patient is single, living alone, and has access to firearms. 

**Suicide assessment**: Using the PHQ-9 as a quick, self-reported scale for depression includes a question (number 9) regarding thoughts of death and self harm with a hazard ratio of 10 and 8.5 for suicide attempts and deaths [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5777328/). The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS) [here](https://cssrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/C-SSRS_Pediatric-SLC_11.14.16.pdf) determines suicide risk with PPV of 14% and NPV of 98%. Other questions that should be asked include questions regarding home dynamics, education/emplyment, activity, drugs, sexual activity, and self harm.

### Treatment [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-023-00454-1)

- **Psychotherapy**: CBT aims to identify and replace negative thought patterns with an emphasis on metacognition, acceptance, and mindfulness. Psychodynamic therapy is rooted in traditional psychoanalysis and helps individuals identify and overcome stressors to make effective decisions.
- **Pharmacologic Therapy**: see pharmacology for more details.
    ![Depression Drugs](/img/depressed_drugs.png)

    Notably, fluoxetine is the only antidepressant which has been shown to be effective in children and adolescents with MDD.
- **Brain Stimulation**: ECT is the most widley used therapy with a primary adverse effect of anterograde amnesia. Most patients repond rapidly (within 1-2 weeks) and so ECT is highly reccomended in patients with severe depression and suicide risk or psychotic/catatonic symptoms and in patients with treatment resistant depression. Other techniques include TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation. 
- **Lifestyle**: exercise is supported by large meta-analyses. Other interventions include relaxation, work directed, and sleep/mindfulness interventions.

### Case Pharmacology

| Drug | Mechanism of Action | Main Side Effects | Metabolism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sertraline (Zoloft) | Selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, increasing the availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission. | Nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, dry mouth, increased sweating, tremor, fatigue, decreased libido | Hepatic metabolism via CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 |
| Escitalopram (Lexapro) | Selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, increasing the availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission. It is the active S-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. | Nausea, increased sweating, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, decreased libido, dry mouth | Hepatic metabolism via CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 |
| Duloxetine | Inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft and enhancing serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. | Nausea, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, increased sweating, decreased appetite | Hepatic metabolism via CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 |
| Naltrexone (for alcohol cravings) | Competitive antagonist at mu-opioid receptors, blocking the rewarding effects of alcohol and opioids. It is thought to reduce alcohol cravings and relapse by modulating the mesolimbic dopamine system and the endogenous opioid system. | Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, dizziness, fatigue, headache, anxiety | Hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation and sulfation |
