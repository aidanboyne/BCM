## Common Ingestion Toxicities

* Amphetamines: Diethylproprione, Methylphenidate, Phenmetrazine, Phentermine, methampetamine, Fenfluramine, MDMA [[ref]](https://emergency.unboundmedicine.com/emergency/view/5-Minute_Emergency_Consult/307063/all/Amphetamine_Poisoning)
    - MOA: increased release of norepinephrine, dopamine, and seratonin. Decreased catechoolamine reuptake. Direct alpha and beta adrenergic agonism.
    - Tachycardia, hypertension, impulsivity, aggression, serotonin syndrome, hyperthermia, psychosis, and seizure
    - Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy in symptomatic methamphetamine intoxication
* Barbiturates [[ref]](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499875/)
    - MOA: enhanced GABA-A receptor activity, keeping Cl channels open hyperpolarizing postsynaptic neuron cell membranes, inhibiting excitatory CNS signals.
    - Confusion, decreased mental status, ataxia, dysarthria, coma, and loss of brain stem reflexes. Depression of the respiratory medullary centers can cause decreased ventilation and apnea. Barbiturates affect the cardiovascular system via vasodilation of peripheral blood vessels, depression of the brainâ€™s cardiac and vasomotor centers, and a direct negative ionotropic effect on the heart.
    - Treatment of barbiturate toxicity consists mainly of supportive care as there is no specific antidote for barbiturate drugs.  However, clinicians should administer intravenous or intranasal naloxone if there is suspicion of opioid co-ingestion and impending respiratory failure. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary for patients who cannot protect their airways or progress to respiratory failure.  
* Benzodiazepines: (-azepams, -zolams, -azepates)
    - MOA:  Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the GABA-A receptor and subsequently lock the receptor into a configuration that increases its affinity for GABA. Benzodiazepines do not alter the production, release, or metabolism of GABA but instead potentiates its inhibitory actions by augmenting or enhancing receptor binding. This binding ultimately increases the flow of chloride ions through the GABA ion channel, causing postsynaptic hyperpolarization, which decreases the ability to generate an action potential.
    - Central nervous system depression ranging from mild drowsiness to a coma-like, stuporous state. The classic presentation of an isolated benzodiazepine overdose consists of CNS depression with normal vital signs.
    - The mainstay treatment for acute benzodiazepine toxicity is supportive care, which may include endotracheal intubation to provide definitive airway management. Single-dose or multi-dose activated charcoal, hemodialysis, or whole bowel irrigation play no role in managing benzodiazepine toxicity.
* Buprenorphine: used to treat OUD and as a analgesic. The mainstreatming addiciton treatment act eliminated the DATA-waiver (X-waiver) program previously required for prescribing. Now all practitioners with Schdeule III authority can prescribe buprenorphine for OUD. 
    - MOA: partial mu opioid receptor agonist. 
    - Mostly fecally excreted. Metabolised by CYP3A4 (induced by carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin. inhibited by ketokonazol, indinavir, saquanavir, erythromycin)
    - Confusion, dizziness, pinpoint pupils, hallucinations, hypotension, respiratory depression, seizures, or coma. The risk of respiratory depression increases when combined with other CNS depressants, particularly benzodiazepines
    - In the event of a buprenorphine overdose, a patient should receive a naloxone bolus dose ranging from 2 mg to 3 mg, followed by a continuous infusion of 4 mg/h. 
* Cocaine [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2703432/)
    - MOA: cocaine binds to several proteins, including monamine transporters, neurotransmitter receptors, plasma proteins, voltage gated ion channels, and metabolic enzymes. Alpha and beta-1 adrenoreceptor stimulation results in the increased heart rate and blood pressure, increasing myocardial oxygen demand. 
    - major effects of cocaine poisoning include CNS effects such as agitation, seizures and psychosis, and cardiovascular effects such as dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular collapse
    - treatment of overdose include benzodiazepines, non0dihydropyridine Ca channel blockers, phentolamine, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and labetalol. Don't use pure beta blockers due to risk of unapposed alpha activation. 
* Opiates: hydrocodone, codeine, oxycodone, morphine,
heroin, fentanyl, methadone
    - MOA: Mu opioid receptor agonists
    - Respiratory depression, coma, and miosis
    - Treat with Naloxone (for acute toxicity) and supportive care
* Phencyclidine (PCP) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859735/)
    - MOA: inhibits ion flux at NMDA glutamate receptor and increases glutamate transmission and non-NMDA receptors via GPCR. It inhibits GABAergic output, decreases DA/NE reuptake, and increases their output. 
    - Over 50% of adult patients present with the classic toxidrome of PCP intoxication: violent behavior, nystagmus, tachycardia, hypertension, anesthesia, and analgesia. Oral doses up to 10mg may induce acute schizophrenia. Other signs are sympathomimetic and cholinergic
        - Mild (I) = unpredictable drunk/euphoric/combative behavior
        - Moderate (II) = stupor, mild coma with bizarre posturing
        - Severe (III) = coma and hyperthermia/seizures which may lead to death.
    - Chemical restraints are preferred over physical restraints, which may exacerbate the risk of rhabdomyolyis. Benzodiazapines are recommended in patients without psychosis, while atypical antipsychotics such as olanzipine or ziprazidone are indicated for psychosis. 

## Acetaminophen (APAP) Toxicity

APAP hepatotoxicity is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the US and a recent study evaluating outcomes in adults with acute liver failure between 1998 and 2013 indicates that hepatotoxicity due to APAP accounted for almost half the cases of ALF for the entire 16-year period, with unintentional APAP overdoses, (those in which patients took excessive medication over several days for ailments like pain or fever) being more common than intentional (suicidal) overdoses.

### Risk Factors

Several factors increase APAP toxicity:

* Decreased hepatic capacity for glucuronidation:
    * Gilbert's disease.
    * Zidovudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
* Inducers of CYP2E1 (increase metabolism of acetaminophen into toxic NAPQI):
    * Isoniazid.
    * Rifampicin, phenobarbital.
    * Phenytoin, phenobarbital.
* Hepatic depletion of glutathione:
    * Chronic alcohol ingestion.
    * Chronic acetaminophen use.
    * Chronic liver disease.
    * Malnutrition.

### Pathophysiology and Liver Toxicity [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5489132/)

Most APAP is metabolized via conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate and excreted into the urine. A minor component of APAP is also oxidized by the microsomal cyto-chrome P450 system, predominantly by Cyp2E1 and Cyp1A2, to form a reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). When conjugation pathways are saturated, a larger portion is oxidized into the toxic NAPQI metabolide. NAPQI can usually be conjugated with gluathione and excreted into bile but when the amount of NAPQI overwhelmes excretion it interacts with protein sulhydryl groups, leading to protein adducts which must be removed via autophagy. 

NAPQI protein adducts in mitochondria lead to increased superoxide formation and activation of MAP kinase JNK eventually leading ot necrotic cell death.

### Presentation and Workup [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054358918300504)

Adults typically need to ingest 12g of APAP or more, while children require about 200mg/kg to reach toxic levels. Hepatotoxicity is defined as ALT elevated to over 1000U/L. Lower levels do not typically warrant emergent concern. The toxicity is divided in 4 stages:
1. Nausea, RUQ pain, normal LFTs. Treatment with NAC within about 8h of ingestion can prevent progression.
2. Elevated AST followed by ALT within 24h of ingestion. Incrased PT and possibly bilirubin.
3. Peak injury around day 3-4 characterized by fulminany hepatic failure with potential complications including hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, vasodilation, shock, profound PT elevations, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and infection. Death can occur due to cerebral edema, septic shock, or hemorrhage
4. Recovery as transaminases and PT return to normal in around 4-14 days. There is no residual hepatic dysfunciton or damage. However, Renal failure is possible and may not completley recover. 

NAC treatment should be given if patients are above the treatment line (lowered to account for inaccurate patient histories) in the Rumack-Matthew normogram. This diagram should only be used in single acute ingestions without chronic APAP use.

### Differential

The main differential diagnoses for patients with serum transaminases elevated into the thousands include drug or toxin-induced hepatic necrosis, ischemic hepatic injury, Wilson Disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and acute viral hepatitis. In a known or highly suspected overdose setting, our experience is that ischemic hepatitis accounts for almost all dramatic elevations of transaminases in the absence of drug- or chemical-induced hepatic injury

### Treatment [[ref]](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/acetaminophen/)

![Treatment APAP OD](/img/APAP_algo.webp)

**N-Acetylcystine (NAC)** is available orally (in 72 hour terrible smelling vomit inducing fomulation) or IV (24 hour, nice formulation). Therapy should be dosed as 150mg/kg over an hour, followed by 50mg/kg over 4 hours and 100mg/kg for 16 hours repeated until acetaminophen <10ug/mL and LFTs begin to improve. Anaphylactoid reactions are possible and can be easily treated.

Activated charcoal can also be considered if patients present within 4 hours of massive (>30g) ingestion. Possibly indicated even later with extended release formulations. Dialysis can be used in massive poisoning (if APAP is >900mg/L)

#### Psychiatric Admission [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2021/0401/p417.html)

Patients who have expressed suicidal ideation but deny current suicidal intent, have no plan or means in place, and have good social support may be treated as an outpatient or referred for outpatient therapy. With the patient's permission, close family or friends should be involved to ensure patient safety and adherence to follow-up care instructions. Crisis planning, including educating patients on coping skills, locating social support, and identifying crisis resources, effectively reduces suicidal ideation and number of days spent in the hospital.

Inpatient admission should be offered to patients with specific plans for suicide who have the means to complete their plan. Where available, treatment options may also include intensive outpatient treatment or partial hospitalization programs. When in doubt about the need for admission, inpatient care is the prudent option. If a patient is referred for admission but not placed in the hospital, they may experience additional stress and increased feelings of helplessness.

Concomitant mood disorder should be reated. Lithium is first line for bipolar disorders and been proven to reduce suicide attempts and mortality. Clozapine, antidepressants, and SSRIs are indicated in certain situations. 

## Depression and Suicidality

People 45 to 54 years and 75 to 84 years have the highest suicide rates; however, increases in other age groups have almost eliminated the age differences. Suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts are highest among people 18 to 25 years, compared with older age groups. White people are twice as likely to die by suicide as Black or Hispanic people.3 Compared with their heterosexual peers, gay men and women are twice as likely to die by suicide, and more than 40% of people who identify as transgender have attempted suicide in their lives.

People living in rural areas are more likely to commit suicide and to do so by firearm. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native people living in rural areas are also at increased risk of suicide.

### Prepping Trauma Bay

Universal precautions should be undertaken by all patients managing the trauma patient:
* Gloves
* Plastic apron or (preferably) full impermeable gown
* Eye protection
* Lead aprons + thyroid shield for staff members that might remain in the room when xrays taken

Based on prehospital notifications, appropriate equipment such as the following may be required:
* Advanced airway equipment
* IV insertion equipment
* IV lines primed
* Rapid infuser primed
* Blood-products
* TXA, analgesia, RSI drugs, antiemetics
* Pelvic binder
* Thoracostamy kit
