### Eitology [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535404/)

* **Diabetes mellitus type 2** (30% to 50%)
* Diabetes mellitus type 1 (3.9%)
* **Hypertension** (27.2%)
* **Primary glomerulonephritis** (8.2%)
* Chronic Tubulointerstitial nephritis (3.6%)
* Hereditary or cystic diseases (3.1%)
* Secondary glomerulonephritis or vasculitis (2.1%)
* Plasma cell dyscrasias or neoplasm (2.1%)
* Sickle Cell Nephropathy (< 1%)

Diabetic nephropathy has shown to have a rapid rate of decline in GFR averaging around 10 ml/min/year.

### Presentation

The gradual decline in function in patients with CKD is initially asymptomatic. However, different signs and symptoms may be observed with advanced kidney failure, including volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, anemia, and mineral and bone disorders (MBDs). The onset of ESKD results in a constellation of signs and symptoms referred to as uremia.

Manifestations of uremia include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system abnormalities (ranging from loss of concentration and lethargy to seizures, coma, and death). No direct correlation exists between the absolute serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, or GFR and the development of these symptoms. Some patients have relatively low levels of BUN (eg, 60 mg/dL [21.4 mmol/L] in an older patient) but are markedly symptomatic, while others have marked elevations (eg, 140 mg/dL [50 mmol/L]) but remain asymptomatic. To continue life, uremic patients require kidney replacement therapy with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation.Among patients with CKD, the risk of death, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, is much higher than the risk of eventually requiring dialysis.

### Diabetic Nephropathy [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534200/)

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in developed countries, including the United States. It is considered a microvascular complication and occurs in both diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). Certain racial groups like African Americans, Native Americans, and Mexican Americans are at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. Studies have noted familial clustering, hinting that genetics plays a part in the risk of developing nephropathy.

Hyperglycemia leads to the production of reactive oxygen species and activation of pathways, including protein kinase C, polyol, hexosamine, and advanced glycation end products (AGE). A significant feature is marked inflammation manifested by an increase in cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, MCP-1, TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta), and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), causing inflammation fibrosis and increased vascular permeability. A podocytopathy ensues, resulting in albuminuria. The resulting systemic and intraglomerular hypertension results in proteinuria. Proteinuria causes epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation leading to fibroblasts and chronic tubular injury.

Diabetic nephropathy is diagnosed by persistent albuminuria on two or more occasions, separated at least by three months on early morning urine samples. Persistent albuminuria is greater than 300 mg over 24 hours or greater than 200 micrograms per minute. Moderately increased albuminuria is when the urine albumin excretion rate is between 30 to 300 mg over 24 hours and is a marker of early DN. It is critical to exclude a urinary tract infection as the cause of albuminuria by a urinalysis. 

Early in the course of the disease, patients are often asymptomatic and are diagnosed during screening with levels of 30 to 300 mg/g creatinine. Once nephropathy sets in, patients present with fatigue, foamy urine (urine protein greater than 3.5 g per day), and pedal edema due to hypoalbuminemia and nephrotic syndrome. They may also have associated peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetic retinopathy.

### Imaging [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535404/)

* If an ultrasound examination of kidneys shows **small kidneys with reduced cortical thickness**, increased echogenicity, scarring, or multiple cysts, this suggests a chronic process. It may also be helpful to diagnose chronic hydronephrosis from obstructive uropathy, cystic enlargement of the kidney in ADPKD.
* Renal ultrasound Doppler can be used in suspected renal artery stenosis to evaluate the renal vascular flow
* Computerized tomography: A low dose of non-contrast CT is used to diagnose renal stone disease. It is also used to diagnose suspected ureteric obstruction which cannot be seen by ultrasonography.
* Renal angiography has its role in the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa where multiple aneurysms and irregular areas of constriction are seen.
* Voiding cystourethrography is mainly used when chronic vesicourethral reflux is suspected as the cause of CKD. It is used to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the severity of reflux.
* Renal scans can give sufficient information about the anatomy and function of kidneys. They are used predominantly in children as they are associated with lesser radiation exposure compared to CT scan. Radionuclide renal scans are used to measure the difference in function between the kidneys.

### Management

The general management of the patient with CKD involves the following issues:
* Treatment of reversible causes of kidney failure
* Preventing or slowing the progression of kidney disease
* Treatment of the complications of kidney failure
* Adjusting drug doses when appropriate for the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
* Identification and adequate preparation of the patient in whom kidney replacement therapy will be required

### Treatment

- ACEI and ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors
- Protein restriction
- Smoking Cessation
- Treatment of underlying metabolic acidosis
- Glycemic Control

## End Stage Renal Disease

End-stage renal disease is defined as a _GFR of less than 15 mL/min_.

### Complications

* **Hyperphosphatemia** is a frequent complication of CKD due to a decreased filtered load of phosphorous. This leads to **increased secretion of PTH** and causes secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism results in the normalization of phosphorous and calcium but at the expense of bone. This results in **renal osteodystrophy**. Therefore, phosphorus binders along with dietary restriction of phosphorus are used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism.
* **Hypertension** is a manifestation of volume expansion in CKD. Patients in CKD do not always have edema to suggest volume expansion. Therefore, all patients with CKD should have a loop diuretic added to control the blood pressure which needs to be titrated before considering an increase in antihypertensive therapy.
* **Anemia** in CKD is usually normocytic normochromic. It is primarily due to **reduced EPO production** from reduced functioning renal mass and also due to reduced red cell survival. Hemoglobin should be checked at least yearly in CKD 3, every 6 months in CKD IV and V, and every 3 months in dialysis patients. Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) in CKD patients should be considered when Hb is less than 10 and provided iron saturation is at least 25% and ferritin greater than 200 ng/mL. In dialysis patients, the goal Hb concentration is 10 to 11.5 gm/dl.

**Hyperkalemia**, **metabolic acidosis**, and the inability to concentrate urine are common after GFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73m2

### Renal Replacement Therapy

* Hemodialysis (home or in-center) performed after stable vascular access is placed in a nondominant arm. In this arm, intravenous cannulas are avoided to preserve the veins. The preferred vascular access is AV fistula. The other hemodialysis access options are AV graft and tunneled hemodialysis catheters. The patency rates of AV fistula is good, and infections are very infrequent. Higher flows can be achieved through AV fistula, and there is less chance of recirculation.
* Peritoneal dialysis (continuous or intermittent)
* Kidney transplantation (living or deceased donor): It is the treatment of choice for ESRD given better long-term outcomes. Eligibility is as follows:
    * End-stage renal disease (dialysis dependent)
    * GFR ≤20 ml/min/1.73m2 (not yet on dialysis)
    * Transplant is **contraindicated in**
        * Severe uncorrectable systemic conditions with short life expectancy
        * Active infection/malignancy/illicit drug abuse
        * Poor functional status
        * Uncontrolled psychiatric disorders
        * High risk medical non-compliance
        * Anatomy that makes transplantation technically impossible

* Patients who do not want renal replacement therapy should be provided with information about conservative and palliative care management.

## CKD related Hyperkalemia

CKD reduces the ability of kidney to excrete potassium in the PCT and DCT. It is especially prevelant in patients with DM (largley due to insulin deficiency) and heart failure, and in patients taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

Hyperkalemia can be classified according to the level of serum potassium into: mild (5.5-6.0 mmol/L), moderate (6.0-6.5 mmol/L), and severe (>6.5 mmol/L). Often, the clinical manifestations present as muscle weakness, paresthesia, paralysis, nausea, dyspnea, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, or cardiac arrest. One study showed that a serum potassium level >6.0 mmol/L was associated with an increase of 30 times in the risk of mortality in one day.

The four major causes of hyperkalemia due to reduced urinary potassium secretion are:
- Reduced aldosterone secretion
- Reduced response to aldosterone (aldosterone resistance)
- Reduced distal sodium and water delivery as occurs in effective arterial blood volume depletion
- Acute and chronic kidney disease in which one or more of the above factors are present

In the event of hyperkalemia, drugs associated with increased serum levels of potassium, such as beta-blockers, mineralocorticoids receptor antagonists, calcineurin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, trimethoprim, and heparin should be adjusted or replaced.

Diabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia:  the combination of insulin deficiency (either impaired secretion or insulin resistance) and hyperosmolality induced by hyperglycemia frequently leads to hyperkalemia even though there may be marked potassium depletion due to urinary losses caused by the osmotic diuresis.

# Hyperkalemia

### Presentation

The most serious manifestations of hyperkalemia are muscle weakness or paralysis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, slow idioventricular rhythms, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole. These manifestations usually occur when the serum potassium concentration is ≥7 mEq/L with chronic hyperkalemia, or possibly at lower levels in patients with an acute rise in serum potassium and/or underlying cardiac conduction disease. 

### EKG

A tall peaked T wave with a shortened QT interval is the earliest change, followed by progressive lengthening of the PR interval and QRS duration. The P wave may disappear, and ultimately, the QRS widens further to a sine wave. Ventricular standstill with a flat line on the ECG ensues with complete absence of electrical activity. The progression and severity of ECG changes do not correlate well with the serum potassium concentration. Conduction abnormalities, such as bundle branch blocks and arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, slow idioventricular rhythms, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, pseudo-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, pseudo-Brugada patterns, and asystole) may also occur in hyperkalemia.

![EKG Hyper/Hypo](/img/hyper_hypokalemai_EKG.png)
_Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia on EKG. Similar to elevated potassium levels, low potassium levels can cause myocardial arrhythmias and significant ectopy. EKG changes can include increased amplitude and width of P wave, T wave flattening and inversion, prominent U waves and apparent long QT intervals due to merging of the T and U wave. Critically low (<1.7 mmol/L) potassium can cause torsades de pointes._

**Calcium** abnormalities can also manifest in EKG. 
* _Hypercalcemia_: QT shortening, may result in J waves or Vfib
* _Hypocalcemia_: Prolonged QT

### Arrythmias [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004667)

* **Altered Resting Membrane Potential:** High extracellular potassium concentration interferes with the normal resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes. In hyperkalemia, the equilibrium potential for potassium becomes less negative, diminishing the transmembrane potential difference. This can lead to depolarization, making the cells more excitable and prone to spontaneous firing.
* **Impaired Repolarization:** Delayed or impaired repolarization occurs as potassium channels become less effective in repolarizing the myocardium. This delays the return of cells to their resting state, prolonging action potentials and increasing the risk of re-entry arrhythmias.
* **Reduced Excitability Threshold:** Hyperkalemia decreases the threshold for depolarization, increasing the excitability of cardiomyocytes. Consequently, it becomes easier for stimuli, such as premature impulses, to initiate abnormal electrical activity.

## Treatment

In patients with a hyperkalemic emergency:
* If ECG changes present and/or serum potassium >6.5 meq/L: Give calcium gluconate 1000 mg (10 mL of 10% solution) or calcium chloride 500 to 1000 mg IV over two to three minutes to stabilize cardiac membranes.
* For ALL hyperkalemic emergencies: Give insulin and glucose to shift K+ intracellularly (give insulin only, without glucose, if serum glucose is >250 mg/dL [13.9 mmol/L]). A common regimen consists of a bolus injection of 10 units of regular insulin, followed immediately by 50 mL of 50% dextrose (25 g of glucose) over 5 minutes. We subsequently infuse 10% dextrose at 50 to 75 mL/hour and closely monitor blood glucose levels every hour for five to six hours.
* Hemodialysis should be performed in patients with ESKD or severe kidney function impairment.
* Loop diuretics (in hypervolemic patients) or saline infusion with IV loop diuretics can be administered (eg, 40 mg of furosemide every 12 hours) to nonoliguric patients without severe kidney function impairment.
* A gastrointestinal cation exchanger (eg, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 10 g orally or patiromer 8.4 g orally) can be given, especially in patients with severe kidney function impairment in whom hemodialysis cannot be swiftly performed. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (15 to 30 g orally) should not be given unless there are no other options to effectively remove potassium from the body in a timely fashion.

### Diuretics and Potassium


#### Thiazide Diuretics
Thiazides, such as hydrochlorothiazide, act on the distal convoluted tubule by inhibiting the Na-Cl co-transporter. This leads to increased sodium excretion, and, as a secondary effect, it may stimulate aldosterone release, promoting potassium loss. Thiazides are associated with a risk of hypokalemia.

#### Loop Diuretics
Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, inhibit the Na-K-2Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This results in increased sodium and water excretion. The enhanced delivery of sodium to the distal tubule can stimulate aldosterone release, promoting potassium excretion. Consequently, loop diuretics can lead to hypokalemia.

#### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
##### Aldosterone Antagonists
Aldosterone antagonists, like spironolactone and eplerenone, competitively inhibit aldosterone receptors. By doing so, they reduce potassium excretion in the collecting duct. These agents can cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function.
##### ENaC Inhibitors
Amiloride and triamterene block the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the collecting duct, reducing potassium secretion. These potassium-sparing diuretics tend to elevate serum potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia.

#### Osmotic Diuretics
Osmotic diuretics, such as mannitol, exert their effects in the proximal tubule and descending limb of the loop of Henle. They increase osmolarity, leading to water retention in the tubular lumen. While they may cause mild potassium loss, their primary mechanism is not directly related to potassium regulation.

#### Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, like acetazolamide, act in the proximal convoluted tubule to inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. This leads to bicarbonate diuresis, and though it can result in metabolic acidosis, the impact on potassium levels is generally minimal.

### ESRD and Medicare [[ref]](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/end-stage-renal-disease)

If you have ESRD, you can get Medicare no matter how old you are if all of these apply:
* Your kidneys no longer work (GFR < 15mL/min/1.73m2)
* You need regular dialysis or have had a kidney transplant
* One of these applies to you:
    * You've worked the required amount of time under Social Security, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), or as a government employee
    * You’re already getting or are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits
    * You’re the spouse or dependent child of a person who meets either of the requirements listed above

### Importing Drugs [[ref]](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/imported-drugs-raise-safety-concerns)

Importing unapproved prescription drugs is illegal, but the FDA's guidance on importing prescription drugs for personal use recognizes that there may be circumstances in which the FDA can exercise discretion to not take action against the illegal importation. The current policy is not a law or a regulation, but serves as guidance for FDA personnel. The importation of certain unapproved prescription medications for personal use may be allowed in some circumstances if all of these factors apply:

* If the intended use is for a serious condition for which effective treatment may not be available domestically
* If the product is not considered to represent an unreasonable risk
* If the individual seeking to import the drug affirms in writing that it is for the patient's own use and provides the name and address of the U.S.-licensed doctor responsible for his or her treatment with the drug or provides evidence that the drug is for continuation of a treatment begun in a foreign country
* If the product is for personal use and is a three-month supply or less and not for resale, since larger amounts would lend themselves to commercialization
* If there is no known commercialization or promotion to U.S. residents by those involved in distribution of the product.
