# Bates' Physical and History Notes

## Chapter 1

#### Structure of Clinical Encounter
1. Initiating the encounter 
 - Setting the stage/preparation 
 - Greeting the patient and establishing initial rapport
2. Gathering information 
 - Initiating information gathering 
 - Exploring patientâ€™s perspective of illness 
 - Exploring biomedical perspective of disease including relevant background and context
3. Performing the physical examination 
4. Explaining and planning 
 - Provide correct amount and type of information
 - Negotiate plan of action Shared decision making
5. Closing the encounter

#### Types of examination
 - Comprehensive: new patients
 - Problem oriented: urgent care/specific complaint, established patients

During exam, will get symptom descriptions, patient feelings, concerns - **subjective info** - as well as physical exam info, labs, and diagnositic chest - **objective info**.

#### HPI
Fully characterize the cheif complaint. For each symptom, consider:
1. Location
2. Quality
3. Severity
4. Onset, Duration, Frequency
5. Modifying Factors
6. Associated Manifestations

OLD CARTS: onset, location, duration, character, aggrevating/alleviating, radiation, timing, setting

**Elements of HPI**
 - Opening statement: AB is xx-yo male with _relevant info_ presenting with _symptoms_. 
 - Description of cheif complaint: consider chronological list, including OLD CARTS as needed.
 - Accompanying and absent symptoms: note the precence or absent symptoms or signs that you would expect to find if possible diagnosis were true - things that assist in making differential diagnosis.
 - Additional info: anything (i.e. smoking history, travel history...) pertinent to diagnosis. Do not list twice - list "see HPI" if you would repead in other documentation.
 - Conclusion: How and why patient came to your care
 
#### Health History

First, look at constitutional symptoms:
 - Fatigue: depression/anxiety, infections, heart failure, chronic lung, kidney, liver disease, electrolyte imbalance, anemia, malignancies, nutritional deficits, medication
	- Sleep patterns, psychological history
 - Weakness: neuropathy, myopathy
	- Req. neuro exam
 - Fever, chills, night sweats: bacteremia, menopause, TB, malignancy, sepsis. 
	- Watch for NSAIDs
	- Focus on timing and associated symptoms
 - Weight change: 
	- Rapid = fluid change, edema.
	- Slower = drug associated gain/loss, diabetes, diet, anorexia/bulimia, chronic cardiac, pulmo, renal failure, depression.
	- Check for malnutrition
 - Pain: OLDCARTS, get psychosocial history
 
 
#### Physical Exam
1. Visual survey
	- Conciousness, appearance, visual pain, wheezing/couching, pallor, sweating, unusual posture, lesions, dress.
	- Fingernails, breath and body odor
	- Facial expression
	- Tremors and impaird gait
2. Calculate BMI (kg/m^2)
	- Underweight <18.5, Normal 18.5-24.9, Overweight 25-29.9, Obesity I 30-34.9 II 35-39.9, Extreme Obesity III >40.
3. BP
4. Orthostatic BP if indicated
5. Arterial pulses, HR, rythm
6. Breathing rate, rythm, depth
7. Temp
8. Acute and chronic pain if indicated
