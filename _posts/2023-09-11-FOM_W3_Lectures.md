# Week 3 Monday Notes

## Lecture 1: Bioenergetics

Gamma-beta bond in ATP used for muscle contraction. Beta-alpha bond in ATP used for RNA synthesis.

ATP is derived primarily from carbohydrates and triglycerides. Carbs - 4cal, triglycerides and ketone bodies - 9cal (req. mitochondria), proteins - 4 cal (starvation only), alcohol - 7 calories.

After very protein rich meals, both insulin _and_ glucagon are released in order to facilitate nutrient uptake and gluconeogenesis.

Creatine Phosphate is high energy compound abundant in muscle and brain that allows rapid replenishment of ATP prior to glycolysis.

Muscle glycogen, unlike liver, is very selfish. Liver stores about 100g glycogen and exports when blood glucose is low. Muscle stores about 400g glycogen for muscle use only. Adipose tissue distributes triglycerides as fatty acids (bound to albumin in blood) and glycerol.

Insulin promotes glycogen storage and TGs. Glucagon and epinepherine promotes glycogen and TG degredation.

## Lecture 2: Lipid and protein metabolism

* Glycerol, FA, and cholesterol have limited polar groups with some water interaction. TG and cholesteryl ester are completley hydrophobic.

* FA and cholesterol stored and transported as hydorphobic esters inside VLDL, LDL, HDL, and chylomicrons. We _consume_ in diet as TG and cholesteryl esters.

* Acetate cannot make glucose (only 2 C) so can only be used for FA synthesis.

After meals, intestine uses dietary lipids to package chylomicrons and release into blood. Between meals, liver synthesizes FA and cholesterol - packages these new synthesis and lipids from blood into VLDL into blood. **Chylomicrons after food, VLDL otherwise**. IDL are rare in normal people. LDL is VLDL leftover after it gives up all FA and is very cholesterol rich. It has a long half-life and can be oxidized and form plaque.

 * LDL is considered "bad" cholesterol as it leads to plaque formation while HDL is "good" as it cleans up cholesterol in body and brings to liver for excretion. 

Statins help decrease LDL cholesterol by inhibiting synthesis in the liver (as we make 70% of cholesterol endogenously). When we don't have sufficient endogenous production, liver brings in more LDL hence statins further bring down LDL plasma levels. They **_Inhibit HMG-CoA Reductase_** a key enzyme in choleesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA to Mevalonate).

### Plaque formation 

Foam cells with LDL particles go under endothelial cell layer of vessels, narrowing intervascular space. If plaque ruptures, can embolise and cause strokes, PEs.

### Alcohol

Ketone bodies have the advantage of being blood soluble and can provide energy to brain (unlike fatty acids). Alcohol cannot make glucose, but can be processed by liver to produce acetate which can be passed to TCA or made into ketone bodies.

![Reddy alcohol metabolism](/img/reddy_alcohol.png)

### Genetic Metabolic Deficiencies

DNA linear in 23 chromosomal pairs in nucleus. Mitochondria has circular DNA. Proteins are synthesized in both the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria. Human DNA has approximately 20k protein-coding genes, but only a subset are transcribed in particular cells.

If proteins are made without any particular localization signals, they will remain in the cytoplasm. Additional signals indicate trafficking to ER where further transport will take place.

The endomembrane system consists of ER, golgi, and lysosomes/vacuoles. Responsible for protein and some lipid synthesis. RER keeps proteins in lumen of ER to go to SER which stores and packages to cis face of Golgi which merges to import and modify for delivery through trans face of golgi.

### Protein misfolding diseases

Normally, misfolded proteins are refolded by chaperones. If this is unsuccessful, they are degraded.

**Prions**: PrPc is a normal protein with alpha helix - soluble and can be eliminated from brain cells. In BSE it is misfolded as PrPsc with beta sheath causing buildup and disease. The beta sheath protein form is so stable that it can cross GI tract and end up in the brain.

**CF**: Class II CFTR mutation, deletion of phenylalanine preventing proper Cl- transport in lungs

**alpha1-antitripsyn deficiency**: produced in liver and released into blood to protect lungs from neutrophil elastase. Polymerization is gain of toxic function leading to liver cirrhosis while degradation is loss of function disorder causing lung disease.

### Exocytosis and secretion toxins

Neurotransmitter vesicle release at synapse is triggered by Ca2+ entry into cell. Insulin release also promoted by Ca2+. 

**Tetanus Toxin**: protease that cleaves receptors used for vesicle movement in neurons: block inhibitory neurotransmitters --> lockjaw. _Spastic paralysis_

**Botulinum Toxin**: cleaves synaptic proteins blocking acetylcholine release --> descendant paralysis from cranial nerves down to extremities. _Flaccid paralysis_

### Urea Cycle

Urea synthesis occurs in the liver cytoplasm and mitochondria. The carbon in urea comes from carbon. Liver tissue markers are ALT and AST. If we have urea cycle disorders, we want to limit dietary proteins. 

Most frequent urea cycle disorder is mutation in OTC gene (orthinine trascarboamylase), an X-linked recessive enzyme. It is treated with diet and sodium phenylbutyrate which is metabolized to phenylacetate that conjugates with glutamine which is excreted by kidneys providing additional nitrogen elimination route. We also supplement arginine (which cannot be produced in OTC disorders) to keep normal urea cycle 

## Lecture 3: Insulin

Key transporters include K+ channel, Ca2+ channel, and GLUT2 transporter. When high amounts of glucose enter via GLUT2, intercellular ATP increases closing the ATP gated K+ channel. This depolarizes the cell causing voltage gated Ca2+ channel (_L-type_) to open and increasing intercellular Ca2+ levels. This triggers insulin vesicle exocytosis into bloodstream. 

L-type channels are also in the heart and are the target of some Ca2+ channel blockers in hypertension management. Overdose can block pancreatic Ca2+ channels, preventing exocytosis of insulin and leading to hyperglycemia.

Sulfonylureas are potassium channel blockers, depolarizing beta cells and causing Ca2+ influx and insulin release. Somatostatins (i.e. Octreotide) can treat sulfonylurea overdose - causing serious hypoglycemia - by blocking L Ca2+ channels in beta cells and preventing insulin release.

### Metabolic Regulation
 - **Glucose**: Decreases blood glucose by upregulating uptake. Promotes _glycogenesis_ and _glycolysis_, inhibits _glycogenolysis_, and reduces _gluconeogenisis_.
 - **Proteins**: Inhibit proteolysis. Stimulates amino acid uptake and protein synthesis.
 - **Lipids**: stimulates lipogenesis (FA and TG production) and inhibits lipolysis
 - **Potassium**: Regular insulin (IV) can be given to treat _hyperkalemia_ via Na+/K+ ATPase pump activation, increasing cellular uptake of K+ and lowering K+ in blood. Administer alongside IV glucose (to prevent hypoglycemia)

### Enteral Administration
 - Per oral
 - Sublingual
 - Rectal

Very easy to administer. However, enteral administration typically has slower onset. It also goes through first pass metabolism and has reduced bioavailability. You also have to think about structural stability.

### Parenteral Administration
 - IV
 - IM
 - SC

 High bioavailability, fast onset, don't have to worry too much about durability (i.e. stomach acid). Is invasive, requires more equipment, and requires additional skills.

 Insulin is given parenterally because it does not survive stomach environment and is not easily transported by intestine. 

 |     Insulin Class    |     Onset Action    |     Peak Effect    |     Duration of Action    |     Pharmaceutical Strategy    |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|     Rapid Acting    |     1-15    |     1    |     3-4    |     Most similar to endogenous insulin    |
|     Short Acting    |     30    |     2-3    |     5-8    |     Produced as Hexamer    |
|     Intermediate Acting    |     1-24    |     4    |     16-24    |     PROTAMINE AND ZINC = less soluble    |
|     Long Acting    |     1-2    |     None    |     20-24    |     Microcrystals at injection for slow   release or side chain binding to albumin    |

### Random
 - Tay-Sachs is lysosomal storage disorder due to missing enzyme
 - Insulin is taken into cell via various mechanisms and degraded. Receptors generally recycled.

## Anatomy

- Musculoskeletal moves lymphatic fluid. 
- Soma in CNS: nuclei. Soma in PNS: ganglion
- Sympathetic nerves found from **T1-L2** (14 pairs of origins). Presynaptic sympathetics (myelinated) arise in lateral horn and use sympathetic chain as elevator to required spinal nerve and synapse onto soma of postsynaptic sympathetic fiber. Postsynaptic fiber (unmyelinated) will hitchhike on spinal nerve to target tissue.
- Every muscle has multiple innervating nerves (myotome) for redundancy.

### Testing

Reference range is 2 SD of mean of normal people without disease covering 95% of the population.
- Screening: No symptoms, impacted by prevalence, determine therapy and predict future
  - Pregnancy, PAP, mammography, COVID, TB, Blood pressure, HIV...
- Diagnostic: symptomatic, impacted by prevalence, determines therapy and predicts futures. ID or characterize disease
  - CT, Biopsy, PCR, EKG, A1C, Kidney function...
- Prognostic: patient has disease, says something about future. How likely to develop
  - Staging, Grading...
- Therapy Guiding: similar to above but determine what therapy, dose, and measure how well it is working
  - Kidney Function, Liver Function, Abx Susceptibility

Same test can fit multiple categories depending on the situation (i.e. HbA1C)

### Metabolic Summary

![Pathways summary](/img/metabolic_summary.png)

### Insulin Overview

- **Origin and Production**:
  - Insulin, derived from the Latin word *insula* meaning "island", is a hormone responsible for reducing blood sugar levels after a meal.
  - It is produced by the **islets of Langerhans** located in the pancreas, specifically by **beta cells**. 
  - Although the pancreas primarily produces digestive enzymes, 1-2% of its mass is dedicated to the islets of Langerhans.
  - Other cells in the islets include:
    - **Alpha cells**: Produce glucagon.
    - **Delta cells**: Produce somatostatin.
    - **Gamma cells**: Produce pancreatic polypeptide.
    - **Epsilon cells**: Produce ghrelin.

- **Insulin Synthesis**:
  - Insulin, encoded by the INS gene on chromosome 11, starts as **preproinsulin**.
  - The leader peptide is removed to form **proinsulin** with B, C, and A peptide chains.
  - Further processing results in the removal of the C-peptide, leaving the B and A chains linked by two disulfide bonds to form mature insulin.

- **Insulin Secretion**:
  - The primary trigger is elevated blood glucose levels.
  - Other stimulatory factors:
    - Hormones like glucagon and cortisol.
    - Increased blood fatty acid or amino acid concentrations.
    - Acetylcholine from the parasympathetic nervous system.
  - Inhibitory factors:
    - Norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system.
    - Somatostatin.
    - Other hormones like growth hormone.

- **Insulin's Action**:
  - Targets liver cells, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscles. It is an _anabolic hormone_.
  - Binds to the insulin receptor (alpha subunits) which relay signal through beta subunits, promoting the conversion of energy molecules into storage forms.
    - Glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver.
    - Fatty acids are stored in adipose tissue.
    - Amino acids are used to build proteins in muscles.
  - In the liver:
    - Promotes glucose conversion into glycogen.
    - Inhibits gluconeogenesis.
    - Converts excess glucose to fatty acids when glycogen storage is full.
  - In adipose tissue, it promotes storage and inhibits breakdown of fats.
  - In skeletal muscles, insulin stimulates glucose and amino acid uptake, supporting muscle growth.

- **Regulation with Glucagon**:
  - Glucagon, also produced by the pancreas (by alpha cells), raises blood glucose levels.
  - Post-meal, rising glucose levels lead to insulin secretion and glucagon inhibition.
  - When blood glucose drops, insulin production decreases, and glucagon secretion resumes.

### Glucagon

- **Origin and Production**:
  - Glucagon is a hormone responsible for elevating blood sugar levels during fasting.
  - It's produced in the **islets of Langerhans** in the pancreas, specifically by **alpha cells**.

- **Glucagon Synthesis**:
  - Encoded by the GCG gene on chromosome 2, glucagon originates as **preproglucagon**.
  - It undergoes modifications, removing the leader peptide to form **proglucagon**, which is then further processed to produce mature glucagon.
  - This mature glucagon is stored within granules in alpha cells, ready for release.

- **Regulation of Glucagon Secretion**:
  - The primary regulator is glucose.
  - When blood glucose is low, e.g., during fasting or intense physical activity, glucagon is released.
  - Stimulants include:
    - Adrenaline from the sympathetic nervous system.
    - Cholecystokinin from intestinal cells.
  - Inhibitors include:
    - High blood glucose levels.
    - Insulin.
    - Somatostatin.
    - Growth hormone.

- **Glucagon's Action**:
  - Targets primarily the liver and adipose tissue.
  - Binds to the glucagon receptor (G-protein).
    - The inside end of this receptor activates intracellular proteins.
  - Being a catabolic hormone, glucagon promotes the breakdown of storage molecules.
    - In the liver: Converts glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) and produces glucose through gluconeogenesis.
    - Increases blood glucose levels.
    - In the liver and adipose tissue: Promotes fat breakdown (lipolysis), releasing fatty acids into the bloodstream for energy.

- **Balancing Act with Insulin**:
  - Glucose levels are regulated through the interplay of glucagon and insulin.
  - Insulin, produced by beta cells, decreases blood glucose levels.
  - Post-meal, rising glucose levels trigger insulin secretion, which inhibits glucagon. When glucose levels drop, glucagon secretion resumes.

### Insulin administration

#### Basics:
- **Insulin** is a peptide hormone reducing glucose in the blood, produced by beta cells in the pancreas located in the Islets of Langerhans. Normally released as increased glucose in pancreatic beta cells (from GLUT2 transport) increases intercellular ATP closing ATP-gated K+ channels. This results in depolarization and activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ opening, causing increased Ca2+ which results in insulin secretion (alongside equimolar C-peptide). 
- **Function**: It facilitates glucose transport into cells. Binding to insulin receptors, it stimulates GLUT4 proteins to embed into the cell membrane, allowing glucose entry.
- **Actions**: Promotes glucose uptake, glycogenesis, glycolysis, lipogenesis, amino acid uptake, protein synthesis, and activates Na+/K+- ATPase pumps. It inhibits glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and proteolysis.

#### Diabetes Types:
- **Type 1**: Due to loss of self-tolerance in T cells, these attack beta cells, decreasing insulin production, causing hyperglycemia.
- **Type 2**: Caused by insulin resistance. The pancreas overproduces insulin until beta cells atrophy, decreasing insulin production.

#### Insulin Administration:
- Given subcutaneously (destroyed in the GI tract).
- Fastest absorption in the abdomen, then arms, thighs, and buttocks.
- Options include syringes, insulin pens, or insulin pumps.

#### Insulin Preparations:
1. **Rapid-acting**: Insulin aspart, lispro, glulisine. 
   - Start: 5-15 mins.
   - Peak: 1 hr.
   - Duration: 3-4 hrs.
2. **Short-acting (Regular insulin)**:
   - Start: 30 mins.
   - Peak: 2-3 hrs.
   - Duration: 5-8 hrs.
   - Can treat hyperkalemia.
3. **Intermediate-acting (NPH insulin)**:
   - Start: 1-2 hrs.
   - Peak: 4 hrs.
   - Duration: 16-24 hrs.
4. **Long-acting**: Insulin glargine, detemir.
   - Start: 1-2 hrs.
   - No peak.
   - Duration: Detemir (20 hrs), Glargine (24 hrs).
5. **Ultra long-acting**: Insulin degludec.
   - Start: 1-2 hrs.
   - No peak.
   - Duration: Up to 48 hrs.

#### Side Effects:
- Hypoglycemia (common in peak-effect insulins).
- Hypokalemia (common with regular intravenous insulin).
- Lipodystrophy (from repeated injections).
- Weight gain.

### Insulin Secretagogues

#### Sulfonylureas:
- Target: Pancreatic beta cells with calcium and potassium ion channels.
- Mechanism: They close potassium channels, leading to cellular depolarization and insulin release.
- Types:
  1. **First Generation**: chlorproPAMIDE, TOLBUTamide, TOLAZamide.
  2. **Second Generation**: glipiZIDE, glyBURIDE, glimepiride (more potent).
- Side effects:
  - Hypoglycemia (more common with second generation).
  - Weight gain.
  - Gastrointestinal disturbance.
  - Allergic reactions.
  - Rarely, severe skin conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
  - First generation can cause alcohol intolerance.
- **Contraindications**: Not for Type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

#### Meglitinides:
- Mechanism: Similar to sulfonylureas but are rapid-acting with a shorter duration.
- Examples: repaglinide, nateglinide.
- Administered orally before meals to control post-meal glucose levels.
- Side effects: Hypoglycemia and weight gain.

#### Incretins:
- Hormones that stimulate insulin release after meals.
- **GLP-1** (glucagon-like peptide 1) is released in response to increased glucose levels.
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: exenatide, liraglutide.
  - Administered subcutaneously.
  - Mechanism: Increases insulin secretion, reduces glucagon release, slows gastric emptying, enhances satiety.
  - Side effects: Gastrointestinal disturbances, reduced appetite, fatigue, hypoglycemia (when combined with other hypoglycemics), and potential risk for acute pancreatitis.

#### DPP-4 Inhibitors:
- **DPP-4** breaks down GLP-1. Inhibiting DPP-4 allows GLP-1 to be active for longer.
- Examples: SITagliptin, sAXagliptin.
- Mechanism: Similar to incretins.
- Administered orally.
- Side effects: GI disturbances, headache, mild infections.
- **Weight neutral**: They neither cause weight gain nor loss.

#### Cautions:
- Most insulin secretagogues are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Caution is needed for individuals with hepatic or renal impairments.
- Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

### Embryo Development

- **Sperm Journey**:
  - About 200 million sperm enter the vagina.
  - Seminal fluid neutralizes acidic vaginal fluids.
  - Majority of sperm die due to various barriers; only about 1000 reach the uterine tube.
  
- **Capacitation**: Sperm remove their protective glycoprotein coat and plasma membrane in the uterine tube, allowing secretion of the enzyme **hyaluronidase**.

- **Egg Structure**:
  - Surrounded by layers including the **corona radiata** and the **zona pellucida** (jelly coat).
  - Only about 500 sperm cells reach the zona pellucida.
  
- **Acrosome Reaction**: 
  - Sperm release **acrosin** to bore through the zona pellucida.
  - Sperm bind to **ZP3 proteins** on the egg's surface, a process called sperm-binding.

- **Cortical Reaction**: 
  - Triggered by rising calcium levels in the egg after sperm-binding.
  - Forms the **hyaline layer**, preventing other sperms from entering the egg (prevents **polyspermy**).

- **Egg's Cell Division**: 
  - The egg undergoes **meiosis II**, resulting in a mature female ovum (egg) with a **female pronucleus** containing 23 chromosomes.

- **Sperm and Egg Fusion**:
  - The sperm's nucleus becomes the **male pronucleus**.
  - Male and female pronuclei merge, their nuclear envelopes dissolve, and chromosomes align.

- **Syngamy**: 
  - Formation of a single cell (zygote) with genetic information from both parents.
  - This is followed by cell division.

#### Cleavage: The diploid cell undergoes divisions resulting in blastomeres.
  
- **Blastomeres**: Continue to divide forming:
  - Four cells, then eight cells.
  - 16-cell structured cluster known as a **morula** with inner and outer cell masses.
  
- **Blastocyst Formation**:
  - Morula's cells are encased by the **zona pellucida**.
  - Embryoblast cells cluster together forming the **embryonic pole**.
  - Trophoblast cells develop into an **epithelial wall** around the blastocyst.
  - By day four, the blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida, ready for uterine wall attachment.
  
- **Implantation**:
  - Trophoblast cells release **L-selectin molecules** aiding in attachment to carbohydrate receptors on the uterine wall.
  - The **blastocyst** attaches to the uterus wall.
  - Outer layer cells (**trophoblast cells**) penetrate the uterus, connecting the blastocyst and the mother.
  - Inner layer cells (**embryoblast cells**) form a flat, two-layered structure leading to all organs and tissues.

- **Implantation**:
  - By day 7 or 8, the blastocyst implants on the endometrial wall (**decidua**). Implantation area is termed **decidua basalis**.
  - Trophoblast cells split into:
    - **Cytotrophoblast** (mononucleated cells).
    - **Syncytiotrophoblast** (multinucleated cells) which expands into the decidua basalis.
  - By day 11, the blastocyst is nearly submerged within the decidua basalis.

- **Decidual Reaction**:
  - Occurs around day 12.
  - Progesterone enlarges decidual cells which become coated in nutrient-rich fluid.
  - Initially happens at decidua basalis but spreads throughout the decidua.

- **Formation of Primary Villi**:
  - Around day 14, **syncytiotrophoblast cells** form tree-like protrusions, **primary villi**.
  - Spaces called **lacunae** form between the primary villi.
  - Parental arteries and veins grow into the decidua basalis.
  - Arteries fill lacunae with oxygenated blood, and veins take it back.
  - Pools of blood merge to form **junctional zone** containing fetal villi.

- **Bilaminar Embryonic Disc**:
  - Formed by the inner embryoblast cells.
    - **Hypoblast**: Ventral layer lining the blastocoel, now known as the **yolk sac** (filled with vitelline fluid).
    - **Epiblast**: Dorsal layer producing all three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) of the embryo.
  - **Amniotic cavity** forms above the bilaminar disc, lined with epiblast cells.
  
- **Extraembryonic Mesoderm Cells**:
  - Epiblast cells differentiate into **extraembryonic mesoderm cells** outside the developing embryo.
  - These cells line the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast and start forming the **chorionic cavity**.

#### From Blastocyst to Gastrula**:
  - Gastrulation begins around day 14.
  - By the end of gastrulation, the blastocyst transitions into a gastrula.

- **Primitive Streak Formation**:
  - The **primitive groove** forms on the epiblast layer, running from the tail (caudal) to head (cranial) end.
  - This groove represents the embryo's bilateral symmetry.
  - **Primitive node** and **primitive pit** develop at the cranial end of the groove, collectively forming the **primitive streak**.

- **Cell Differentiation**:
  - Epiblast cells migrate to the primitive groove.
    - Deep diving cells form the embryonic **endoderm layer**, replacing the hypoblast.
    - Shallow diving cells form the embryonic **mesoderm layer**.
    - Remaining epiblast cells form the embryonic **ectoderm layer**.
  - This forms the **trilaminar disc** with ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm layers, which are multipotent.

- **Formation of Bilaminar Regions**:
  - Around day 15, two bilaminar regions form:
    - Cranial region becomes the **oropharyngeal membrane** (future mouth opening).
    - Caudal region becomes the **cloacal membrane** (future anus and genitourinary openings).

- **Notochord Development**:
  - Around day 17, a solid rod called the **notochord** forms.
  - Though transient, it influences embryonic folding and secretes Sonic HedgeHog (SHH) protein, aiding tissue differentiation.

- **Mesoderm Differentiation and Neurulation**:
  - On day 20, mesoderm cells differentiate into **paraxial mesoderm**, **intermediate mesoderm**, and **lateral plate mesoderm**.
  - The notochord stimulates ectoderm cells to form the **neural plate**.
    - This plate folds, creating a **neural groove** and **neural folds**.
    - The folds merge, forming the **neural tube** between mesoderm and ectoderm.

- **Placental Connection**:
  - Syncytiotrophoblast cells continue to embed the embryo in the uterus.
  - **Primary villi** of the trophoblast layer delve deeper into maternal blood.
  - Extraembryonic mesoderm cells migrate into the primary villi, forming **secondary villi**.
    - These differentiate into small fetal blood vessels, forming the **villous capillary system**.
  - This establishes the circulatory link between embryo and parent, readying for nutrient and oxygen flow upon fetal heartbeats.


## Endocrine System

Organs that secrete steroid (cholesterol derived) or non-steroid hormones into the bloodstream. Adrenal glands and gonads make steroids which travel via transport proteins and diffuse directly into cell to activate nuclear receptors. Non-steroid hormones include:
 - Peptidic hormones: free floating in blood, bind to cell surface receptors (i.e. insulin, glucagon)
 - Amino acid hormones: thyroid hormones (similar to steroid with transport and nuclear receptor), adrenaline and noradrenaline (cell surface receptors)

**Hypothalamus and pituitary** connected and make hormones controlling thyroid adrenal glands and gonads. Hypothalamus made up of clusters of neurons known as nuclei that connect to pituitary via posterior lobe consisting of the nerve axons. The hypothalamus riecives temp, osmolarity, danger signals that are stored in posterior pituitary or act on anterior to secrete its own hormones.
 - Anterior pituitary is connected via hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system.
   - stimulatory: thyrotropin (TRH) --> TSH produced --> T3/T4 produced in thyroid, corticotropin (CRH) --> ACTH produced --> cortisol produced in adrenal, gonadotropin (GnRH) --> gonadotropins produced (FSH, LH) regulating production and maturation of gametes and production of sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone), growth (GHRH) --> growth hormone production --> direct effects on long bones and other tissues.
      - Estrogen in cycle is only positive feedback loop in the systems shown above
   - Inhibitory: GHIH/somatosatin --> secrete less growth hormone, prolactin inhibiting factor --> continuously secreted outside of breast feeding, suckling halts inhibitor production.
 - Posterior pituitary connected via axons of paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Secrete ADH (released with high osmolarity or low volume) and oxytocin (dialates cervix and stimulates uterine contractions, also contract muscle in breast) down length of axons stored in herring bodies until release into posterior pituitary capilaries 

**Pineal gland** is behind hypothalamus made up of pinealocytes that secrete melatonin regulating circadian rythm. 

**Thyroid** is at front of neck with two lobes. Follicles make T3 and T4 that increase basal metabolic rate of cells. Parafollicular cells (C-cells) secrete calcatonin. **Parathyroid glads** (4) make parathyroid hormone also involved in calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism.

**Adrenal Glands** are just above kidneys made of outer cortex surrounding medulla. The cortex has 3 zones. Zona glomerulosa makes aldosterone (low BP or excessive K+ preventing H20 and Na loss and increases K elimination), fasciculata makes cortisol (stress), and reticulans makes sex precursors. The medulla makes Adrenaline and norepinepherine.

The **pancreas** has endocrine function (insulin from Beta cells and glucagon from Alpha cells), along with exocrine function (digestive enzymes)

## **Anatomy of the Nervous System**

The nervous system is primarily categorized into two main parts:
1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Comprises the **brain** and **spinal cord**.
2. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: Consists of all nervous tissues outside the CNS.

### **Neurons (Nerve Cells)**
- Fundamental units of the nervous system.
- Main section is the **cell body** which contains the nucleus.
- Extensions from the cell body: 
  - **Dendrites**: Short projections that receive electrical signals.
  - **Axon (Nerve Fiber)**: Single long extension that transmits electrical impulses.
    - Many axons have a **myelin sheath**, a lipid-protein layer that accelerates impulse conduction.
    - The end of an axon is the **axon terminal** which can connect to a dendrite of another neuron at a **synapse**, enabling neuron communication.
- Types of Neurons:
  - **Multipolar Neurons**: Common type, with multiple dendrites and a single axon. E.g., motor neurons controlling voluntary muscles.
  - **Bipolar Neurons**: One dendrite and one axon, often acting as sensory neurons. E.g., cells in the nasal cavity for the sense of smell.
  - **Pseudounipolar Neurons**: Seemingly single but double process extending from the cell body, with both sensory and central processes.

### **Neuroglia (Glial Cells)**
- Supporting cells of the nervous system.
- Functions include nourishing and aiding neurons.
- There are more glial cells than neurons in the body (5:1 ratio).

### **Central Nervous System (CNS)**
- **Gray Matter**:
  - Found in the outer part of the brain as the **cerebral cortex**.
  - Contains neuron cell bodies.
  - In the spinal cord, it appears butterfly-shaped with **anterior** and **posterior horns**.
- **White Matter**:
  - Inner part of the brain, mainly axons transmitting signals.
  - The myelin sheath gives it a white appearance.
  - In the spinal cord, it surrounds the gray matter.
- **Nucleus**: A group of neuron cell bodies in the CNS. E.g., basal nuclei in the brain.
- **Tract**: A bundle of axons in the CNS. E.g., corticospinal tract.

### **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**
- **Ganglion**: Group of cell bodies in the PNS. E.g., dorsal root ganglion.
- **Nerve**: Bundle of axons in the PNS.
  - **Spinal Nerves**: Arise from the spinal cord. They combine sensory (**dorsal roots**) and motor (**ventral roots**) fibers. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves categorized by region and level (e.g., T5 spinal nerve for the fifth thoracic region). They further branch into **anterior** and **posterior rami**.
  - **Cranial Nerves**: 12 pairs arising from the brain, mainly serving the head and neck. They can be sensory, motor, or mixed.

### **Dermatomes and Myotomes**
- **Dermatome**: Skin area innervated by a specific spinal nerve. E.g., T10 dermatome around the belly button.
- **Myotome**: Muscle area supplied by a particular spinal nerve.
- They help visualize regions supplied by each spinal nerve pair.

## **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Subdivisions**

### **1. Somatic Nervous System**
- **Function**: Controls voluntary actions and conveys sensory information.
- **Somatic Sensory Fibers**: Transmit sensory information such as touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception. 
- **Somatic Motor Fibers**: Innervate skeletal muscles to control voluntary actions.

### **2. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**
Controls involuntary body activities.
- **Visceral Motor Fibers**: Carry motor signals to smooth muscle (e.g., intestinal walls for peristalsis), cardiac muscle, and glands.
- **Visceral Sensory Fibers**: Carry sensory information from organs to CNS.
  - **Function**: Continuously regulate the activity of the visceral motor neurons of the ANS. 
  - **Example**: Monitoring oxygen levels in blood, blood pressure, or stomach fullness after eating.

### **3. Special Sensory Fibers**
Convey sensory information related to special senses: smell, sight, taste, hearing, and balance. While not strictly part of the somatic or autonomic systems, they can influence both.

### **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Details**
#### **Subdivisions**:
1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**: 
   - Activated during 'fight or flight' situations.
   - Effects include pupil dilation, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and prioritizing blood flow to essential organs like the brain and muscles.
   - Reduces activity in non-essential organs during stress (e.g., kidneys, digestive system).
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS)**:
   - Activated during 'rest and digest' scenarios.
   - Reduces heart rate and blood pressure, increases digestion and blood flow to non-essential organs.
3. **Enteric Nervous System**: Sometimes considered the third subdivision. Regulates the gastrointestinal tract, capable of acting independently but also influenced by the CNS.

#### **Neural Communication in ANS**:
- **Preganglionic Neuron**: First neuron sending a signal from the CNS. All arise from between **T1-L3**. and leave through anterior rami.
  - Nuclei in the **intermediolateral nucleus**.
  - Exit via **anterior root** and enter **anterior rami** of spinal nerves **T1-T3**.
  - Upon entering the sympathetic chain, these fibers have four potential pathways to synapse with postganglionic counterparts:
    1. **Direct Synapse**: Immediately connect with the postganglionic cell body in the **paravertebral ganglion** at the same vertebral level.
    2. **Ascend in Chain**: Pass through the paravertebral ganglion, ascend the sympathetic chain, and synapse at a higher vertebral level.
    3. **Descend in Chain**: Pass through the paravertebral ganglion, descend the sympathetic chain, and synapse at a lower vertebral level.
    4. **Splanchnic Route**: Bypass synapsing in the paravertebral ganglia, continue via **splanchnic nerves** to synapse in **prevertebral ganglia** located anterior to the aorta.
- **Postganglionic Neuron**: Neuron that the preganglionic neuron synapses with, usually the effector neuron.
  1. Those synapsing in the **paravertebral ganglia** enter the **gray rami communicantes**, then re-enter and travel along spinal nerves to their target organs.
  2. Fibers bypassing the sympathetic chain continue to the **prevertebral ganglia** to synapse on postganglionic fibers targeting specific organs.
- **Sympathetic Neurons**: Have _short_ preganglionic and _long_ postganglionic fibers.
- **Parasympathetic Neurons**: Have _long_ preganglionic and _short_ postganglionic fibers.

### **Enteric Nervous System (Gut Brain)**
- **Subdivisions**: 
  - **Submucosal Plexus (Meissner Plexus)**: Regulates secretion and absorption in the mucosa.
  - **Myenteric Plexus (Auerbach Plexus)**: Regulates tone and contractions in the gut wall.
- Can act autonomously but influenced by the CNS. The PSNS stimulates digestive activities, while the SNS inhibits them.

## **Lymphatic System Overview**

- **Primary Function**: Protects the body from invaders, maintains fluid levels, and absorbs dietary fat.
- **Components**:
  - **Lymph**: Clear or slightly yellow fluid transported through lymphatic vessels.
  - **Lymphocytes**: White blood cells that play a central role in immune responses.
  - **Lymphatic vessels and plexuses**: Tubes similar to blood vessels that transport lymph.
  - **Lymph nodes**: Filter lymph and house lymphocytes and other white blood cells.
  - **Other lymphoid organs**: Organs like thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and tonsils that produce or house lymphocytes.

### **Lymph and Lymphatic Vessels**

- **Origin**: About 10% of fluid from capillary beds leaks into the extracellular space, becoming lymph when entering lymphatic capillaries.
- **Lymphatic Capillaries**: Tiny, porous capillaries scattered throughout the body, forming lymphatic plexuses.
- **Lymphatic Vessels**: Larger vessels formed by merging capillaries, which carry lymph through lymph nodes and eventually into lymphatic trunks.
- **Lymphatic Trunks**: Drain large body regions. For example, subclavian trunks drain the upper limbs.
- **Lymphatic Ducts**: Final, larger channels formed by converging trunks. There are two main ducts:
  - **Right Lymphatic Duct**: Drains lymph from the right side of the head, neck, chest, and upper limb. It empties into the right venous angle (junction of right internal jugular vein and right subclavian vein).
  - **Thoracic Duct**: Drains lymph from the rest of the body. Begins as the cisterna chyli, passes through the thoracic cavity, and empties into the left venous angle. Ultimately, its contents mix with blood in the superior vena cava, heading to the right atrium of the heart.

### **Lymph Nodes**

- **Function**: Filter lymph and check for foreign invaders.
- **Placement**: Typically close to each other, either superficial or deep in the body.
- **Major Groups**:
  - **Upper Body**:
    - **Cervical Lymph Nodes**: Both sides of the neck.
    - **Posterior Mediastinal Lymph Nodes**: Between the heart and vertebral column.
    - **Axillary Lymph Nodes**: In the axilla or armpit region.
    - **Cubital Lymph Nodes**: In the cubital fossa on the anterior part of the elbow.
  - **Lower Body**:
    - **Lumbar Lymph Nodes**: Near the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta.
    - **Iliac Lymph Nodes**: Around the iliac blood vessels.
    - **Inguinal Lymph Nodes**: Around the groin.
    - **Popliteal Lymph Nodes**: Behind the knees.

This summary provides an overview of the lymphatic system, emphasizing its components and the journey of lymph through the body, and highlighting the major lymph node groups and their locations.
