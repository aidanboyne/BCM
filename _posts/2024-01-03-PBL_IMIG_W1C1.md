# Innate Immune System

The innate immune system comprises inflammation, phagocytosis, debris and pathogen clearance, and remodelling and regeneration of tissues. Phased arrival of leukocytes is moderated by chemokines and endothelial adhesion moledules. 

![Immune Timeline](/img/Immune_timeline.jpg)

Key cytokines released when tissue is damaged include TNF-alpha (produced by macrophages inducing adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte activation), IL-1, IFN-gamma (From Th1 cells), and NF-kappaB. Many other important chemokine mediators are listed in the table below:

| Mediator | Main source | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| Histamine | Mast cells, basophils | Increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, chemokinesis |
| 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5HT (serotonin)) | Platelets, mast cells (rodent) | Increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction |
| Platelet-activating factor (PAF) | Basophils, neutrophils, macrophages | Mediator release from platelets, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, neutrophil activation |
| IL-8 (CXCL8) | Mast cells, endothelium, monocytes and lymphocytes | Polymorph and monocyte localization |
| C3a | Complement C3 | Mast cell degranulation, smooth muscle contraction |
| C5a | Complement C5 | Mast cell degranulation, neutrophil and macrophage chemotaxis, neutrophil activation, smooth muscle contraction, increased capillary permeability |
| Bradykinin | Kinin system (kininogen) | Vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, increased capillary permeability, pain |
| Fibrinopeptides and fibrin breakdown products | Clotting system | Increased vascular permeability, neutrophil and macrophage chemotaxis |
| Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) | Cyclo-oxygenase pathway, mast cells | Vasodilation, potentiates increased vascular permeability produced by histamine and bradykinin |
| Leukotriene-B 4 (LTB 4 ) | Lipoxygenase pathway, mast cells | Neutrophil chemotaxis, synergizes with PGE 2 in increasing vascular permeability |
| Leukotriene-D 4 (LTD 4 ) | Lipoxygenase pathway | Smooth muscle contraction, increasing vascular permeability |

Lymphocytes must migrate to the site of inflammation via the process detailed below.

### PAMPs

Pathogen associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, are molecules preserved across many pathogenic spcies that are recognized by the innate immune system via **Pattern Recognition Recepto (PRRs)** and trigger activity. These include carbohydrates, lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide components of bacterial and fungal cell walls, and the distinctive nucleic acids (e.g. dsRNA) formed during viral replication. There are three types of PRRs:

* Secreted molecules, present in serum and body fluids (such as acute phase reactants including CRP, SAP, PTX3)
* Receptors, present on the cell surface and on endocytic vesicles (such as toll like receptors, or TLRs)
* Intracytoplasmic recognition molecules

PRRs include complement activators such as Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and Ficolins. These lead to pathogen opsonization, facilitating phagocytosis. Phagocytotic cells can also recognize pathogens directly via scavenger receptros, carbohydrage receptors, and TLRs (which may be cell surface or endosomal).

## Complement

Complement can be activated via three pathways, all of which converge on the conversion of C3 into C3a and C3b. 

1. **Classical Pathway**: IgG and IgM antibodies activate C1 via binding of several head groups of C1q, causing C1r to activate C1s. This requires dense IgG coating for sufficient heads to bind. C1s then cleaves C4 and C2, allowing C4b2b (a **C3 convertase**) to convert C3, forming C4b2b3b, a C5 convertase.
2. **Lectin Pathway**: MBL binds mannose (and some other sugar) residues on pathogens, allowing MASP1 and MASP2 to cleave C4 and C2, leading to the C4b2b C3 convertase.
3. **Alternative Pathway**: Spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 allows C3b to bind pathogen surface residues, stabilizing the otherwise short lived compound. C3b can then bind factor B, cleaved to Bb and Ba, forming the C3 convertase C3bBb. Factor I prevents this process from occuring by cleaving C3b to the inactive iC3b, and host cells have CD55 (DAF) which promotes dissociation of C3b from the cell surface. 

### Complement Activation

| | Immunoglobulins | Microorganisms |  |  | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | |  Viruses | Bacteria | Other |  |
| Classical pathway | Immune complexes containing IgM, IgG1, IgG2 or IgG3 | HIV and other retroviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus |   Mycoplasma spp. | | Polyanions, especially when bound to cations PO 4 3 − (DNA, lipid A, cardiolipin) SO 4 2 − (dextran sulfate, heparin, chondroitin sulfate) |
| Lectin pathway | |  HIV and other retroviruses | Many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms |  | | Arrays of terminal mannose groups acetylated sugars |
| Alternative pathway | Immune complexes containing IgG, IgA or IgE (less efficient than the classical pathway) | Some virus-infected cells (e.g. by Epstein–Barr virus) | Many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms | Trypanosomes, Leishmania spp., many fungi | Dextran sulfate, heterologous erythrocytes, complex carbohydrates (e.g. zymosan) |

![Complement Pathway](/img/Complemet_pathway.jpg)

### Complement effects

- **Inflammation**: C3a, C4a, and C5a alll can induce local inflammatory reactions. C5a also directly increases the ability of neutrophils and monocytes to adhere to vessel walls and migrate toward antigen rich sites. 
- **MAC**: The membrane-attack complex (**MAC**) is formed by the terminal complement proteins C5-C9. C5b initially binds C6 and C7 to form C5b67 which then allows C8 to bind and insert the complex into the pathogen membrane. Many C9 molecules bind and polymerize to create a pore in the membrane. 
- **Opsonization**: Complement binding greatly enhances the destruction of pathogens by phagocytotic cells via CR receptors (see table below)

    ![Opson](/img/Opsonize.jpg)

Refs: [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27100/), [[2]](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/book/3-s2.0-B9780702078446000040)


### Cellular Components

**Macrophages:** Phagocytic cells that engulf and digest pathogens. They express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on their surface, allowing them to recognize conserved molecular patterns on microbes known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Binding of PAMPs to TLRs activates signaling cascades, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Macrophages also contribute to antigen presentation by processing and presenting antigens to T cells. This antigen presentation is crucial for the activation of the adaptive immune response. Upon phagocytosis, macrophages fuse the phagosome to the lysosome filled with various antimicrobial substances, including reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, to eliminate the internalized pathogens.

**Neutrophils:** The most abundant type of white blood cells and essential for rapid response to infections. They are highly phagocytic and migrate towards sites of infection in response to chemotactic signals. Neutrophils express various receptors, including complement receptors and Fc receptors, which facilitate their recognition and binding to pathogens. Neutrophils are short-lived cells, and their recruitment and activation are tightly regulated to prevent excessive tissue damage.

**Natural Killer Cells:** NK cells have a primary role in recognizing and eliminating virally infected cells and tumor cells. NK cells recognize altered or absent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on target cells, a phenomenon known as missing-self recognition. Upon activation, NK cells release cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes, leading to target cell lysis. NK cells also produce cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which enhances the overall immune response.

## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)

SIRS is an exaggerated inflammatory reaction to a stressor such as infection, trauma, surgery, etc. Acute phase reactants cause widespread autonomic, endocrine, hematologic, and immune alterations and can potentially result in massive cytokine storm. **Sepsis** is a form of SIRS when infection is present. SIRS is defined by presence of 2 or more of the following:

1. Temp > 38C (100.4F) or < 36C (96.8F)
2. HR > 90bpm
3. RR > 20 or pCO2 < 32 mmHg
4. Leukocytes > 12k or <4k per microliter or > 10% bands

Pediatric patients require either criteria 1 or 4 for diagnosis. SIRS may progress into sepsis (roghly 1/4 of the time) or septic shock (about 1/20) [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16608946/). 

At a cellular level, non-infectious noxious stimuli, an infectious agent or an endotoxin or exotoxin produced by an infection activates a multitude of cells including neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, platelets, and endothelial cells. The early response mediated by these inflammatory cells involves three major pathways:
* Activation of IL-1 and TNF alfa.
* Activation of prostaglandin and Leukotriene pathway
* Activation of C3a – C5a complement pathway

Interleukin 1 (IL1) and tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-alpha) are the early mediators within the first hour. Their role is of paramount importance in tilting the scale towards a proinflammatory overdrive. Their actions can broadly divide into three categories:
* Propagation of cytokine pathway
* Alteration of coagulation causing microcirculatory abnormalities
* Release of stress hormones

# Meningitis

Meningitis is an inflammatory process involving the meninges with a broad differential. Aseptic (usually viral, especially enterovirus) meningitis is the most common form, followed by the much more emergent bacterial variety. Other causes include drug reactions, fungal or parasitic infections, and vasculitis. The annual incidence is unknown because of underreporting, but European studies have shown 70 cases per 100,000 children younger than one year, 5.2 cases per 100,000 children one to 14 years of age, and 7.6 per 100,000 adults.

### Bacterial Meningitis [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0901/p314.html)

Vaccination has nearly eliminated the risk of Haemophilus influenzae and substantially reduced the rates of Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae as causes of meningitis in the developed world. Nonetheless, bacterial meningitis still accounts for about 14% of cases. 

**Presentation**: Fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status are classic symptoms of meningitis, and a combination of two of these occurs in 95% of adults presenting with bacterial meningitis. However, less than one-half of patients present with all of these symptoms. Other symptoms include nausea, rash, and in severe cases, seizure. However, all patients with concern for meningitis should undergo prompy LP and CSF evaluation. CT head is indicated in patients with focal neurologic deficits, hypertension and bradycardia, immunosupression, papulledema, and seizure. Retrosepctive studies advise against CT in favor of more rapid LP in patients with altered mental status.

#### H&P

Meningitis can have a varied clinical presentation depending on age and immune status of the host. Symptoms typically include fever, neck pain/stiffness, and photophobia. More non-specific symptoms include headache, dizziness, confusion, delirium, irritability, and nausea/vomiting. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (altered mental status, neurologic deficits, and seizures) portend a poor prognosis. The following risk factors should increase clinical suspicion:

* Close contact exposures (military barracks, college dorms)
* Incomplete vaccinations
* Immunosuppression
* Children younger than five years and adults older than 65 years
* Alcohol use disorder

One should try to determine a history of exposures, sexual contact, animal contact, previous neurosurgical intervention, recent travel, and the season. Most viral cases tend to occur in the warmer months.

In adults, the physical exam is centered on identifying focal neurologic deficits, meningeal irritation (Brudzinski - patient in supine position, with examiner hands behind head on on chest: replex flexion of hips and knees after passive neck flexion - and Kernig - extension of knee on flexed hip at 90 degrees causes restriction and pain beyond 135 degrees - signs), and particularly in meningococcal meningitis, characteristic skin lesions (petechiae and purpura). Cranial nerve abnormalities are seen in 10%-20% of patients. 

#### Lumbar Puncture

LP findings are the primary distingishing factor between aseptic and bacterial meningitis. Aseptic meningitis typically has has a relativiley low and lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal glucose. Bacterial (pyogenic - not L. Monocytogenes) have higher neutoriphilic pleocytosis with low glucose and high protein. CRP has high negative predictive value, and CSF lactate has fairly high sensitivity and specificity (about 95% and 93%).

#### Bacterial Meningitis Score

The Bacterial Meningitis Score has a sensitivity of 99% to 100% and a specificity of 52% to 62%, and appears to be the most specific tool available currently, although it is not widely used. It reccomends antibotic treatment and admission if a pediatric patient has any of the following:
- CSF gram stain positive
- CSF ANC > 1000 cell/microliter
- CSF protein > 80mg/dL
- Peripheral blood ANC > 10k cell/microliter
- Seizure at or prior to presentation

#### Management

![Treat It](/img/meningitis_treat.gif)

IV antibiotices should be administered inpatient for at least the first 6 days, after which outpatitient IV can be considered. Treatment length varies based on culture. [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0901/p314.html#:~:text=Length%20of%20treatment,home%20environment). Corticosteroids (dexamethasone) are reccomended alongside antibiotic therapy. 

Treatment of viral meningitis is focused on supportive care with acyclovir if there is concern for HSV. TB, cryptococcal, or other fungal etiologies should be considered with travel to endemic area, immunocompromised patient, or HIV infection. 

#### Vaccines

The bacterium meningococcus, recently called Neisseria meningitides, is an exclusively human-encapsulated Gram-negative diplococcus. It colonizes the human nasopharynx (termed nasopharyngeal carriage) and mostly affects children and young people with high mortalities. Rarely, invasive strains of N. meningitides may invade across the mucosal surface, entering the bloodstream and invading the blood-brain barrier, causing septicemia and meningitis, also called invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). To date, worldwide, there are 12 known distinct meningococcal serogroups designated based on the composition of CPS polymers (A, B, C, E, H, I, K, L, W, X, Y, and Z), with serogroups A, B, C, W, Y, and X, being responsible for the majority of disease. These polysaccharides allow for avoidance of opsonization and are the basis of the antigen based vaccines which are available in both polysaccharide and conjugated polysaccharide variants. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553102/) Noteably, there is no vaccine available that provides lifetime immunity. Current vaccines only last 3-5 years.

Vaccines that have decreased the incidence of meningitis include H. influenzae type B, S. pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis. Administration of one of the meningococcal vaccines that covers serogroups A, C, W, and Y is recommended for patients 11 to 12 years of age, with a booster at 16 years of age. However, the initial dose should be given earlier in the setting of a high-risk condition, such as functional asplenia or complement deficiencies, travel to endemic areas, or a community outbreak. There are also two available vaccines for meningococcal type B strains to be used in patients with **complement disease** or functional asplenia, or in healthy individuals at risk during a serogroup B outbreak as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

#### Prophylaxis

Individuals including household members, college dormitories, or those at direct exposure to the patient's oral secretions (by kissing, sharing food, or drinking utensils) should receive prophylaxis within 7-days before symptoms appear. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated instantly, optimally within 24 hours of exposure identification. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens may include oral ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, rifampin, or azithromycin. In which effectiveness is estimated as 90% to 95%.

### Antibiogram

The hospital antibiogram is a periodic summary of antimicrobial susceptibilities of local bacterial isolates submitted to the hospital’s clinical microbiology laboratory. Antibiograms are often used by clinicians to assess local susceptibility rates, as an aid in selecting empiric antibiotic therapy, and in monitoring resistance trends over time within an institution. Antibiograms can also used to compare susceptibility rates across institutions and track resistance trends. They are usually generated by a laboratory using aggregate data from a hospital or healthcare system.

## Pharmeceuticals 

Certainly, let's delve into the mechanisms of action for each of the mentioned drugs:

####  Acetaminophen
**Mechanism of Action:**
   - Acetaminophen primarily acts centrally in the brain by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. It is believed to exert its analgesic (pain-relieving) and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme in the central nervous system.

#### Ibuprofen
**Mechanism of Action:**
   - Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. By blocking these enzymes, it reduces the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for pain, inflammation, and fever.

#### Ceftriaxone
**Mechanism of Action:**
   - Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Specifically, it binds to and inhibits the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), disrupting cell wall formation and leading to bacterial cell lysis.
   - Ceftriaxone is a crucial antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Its broad spectrum of activity, including against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, makes it a first-line choice. In complement-deficient patients, the antibiotic choice remains critical, and ceftriaxone's efficacy against common pathogens is advantageous.

#### Eculizumab
**Mechanism of Action:**
   - Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the complement system by targeting the C5 component. It prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), thus blocking the terminal complement pathway.
   - Complement deficiencies can predispose individuals to recurrent infections, including meningitis. Eculizumab, by inhibiting the complement system greatly increases the risk of meningicoccal disease - By blocking C5, eculizumab inhibits meningococcal serum bactericidal activity (SBA), leaving patients at an approximately 2000-fold higher risk of meningococcal disease than the general population. This increased risk includes invasive disease caused by unencapsulated (non-groupable, NG) strains, which rarely cause invasive disease in normal hosts. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6669166/)

#### Rifampin
**Mechanism of Action :**
   - Rifampin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing transcription and subsequently inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It is particularly effective against mycobacteria and is commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis.

   - Rifampin is not a first-line agent for bacterial meningitis. However, it may be used in certain circumstances, such as in the prophylaxis of contacts exposed to meningococcal meningitis. In this context, rifampin is administered to eradicate carriage of Neisseria meningitidis in the nasopharynx.

#### Case Specifics:
- **Rash**: Petechial rash. Can be caused by meningococcemia (dissemination of Neisseria meningitidis)
- **CSF Interpretation**
- **Low C8**
- **Contrast vs. Non-Contrast Head CT**
