## Four Principles
 - Autonomy: acknowledge the right of every individual to choose and follow his or her own life plan and actions.
 - Non-maleficence: the duty to "do no harm" and to not allow harm to come to a patient through neglect.
 - Beneficence: the duty of a physician to try to bring about improvements in physical or psychological health that medicine can achieve.
 - Justice: physicians must accept the requirement of fairness to their patients.
 
Decisions in medical ethics are made via a framework: Identify the question --> gather facts --> identify ethical considerations (perhaps using a sub-framework) --> make a reasoned argument and reccomendation

## Confidentiality and Privacy
 - Privacy is the right to keep one's information private
 - Confidentiality is the clinician's duty to keep the pateitn's infromation private.
 
Confidentiality is broken often, especially in informal situations such as rides in the eleveator when discussing cases with other practitioners not involved in the patient's care. 

**HIPAA** (Health insurance portability and accountability act): the legal obligation of physicians and health care workers to avoid disclosure of protected health information (PHI). PHI includes
 - Medical history, current conditions, and future prognosis (physical or mental)
 - Information about doctors visits, including procedures and treatments. Also includes if a patient has seen a particular specialist.
 - Info related to payment for past, present, or future healthcare.

HIPPA applies to healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and associates/subcontractors of these organizations.

Certain PHI is permitted, encouraged, or required to be disclosed to appropriate organizations and/or individuals. The specific PHI varies by state. For example, physicians are permitted to disclose HIV status to spouses in Texas, but not to any non-spouse partner. Suspected child abuse and certain communicable diseases are required to be reported to government agencies.

_Disclosure_ 

If the patient makes informed consent, PHI disclosure is permitted to anyone the patient indicates. PHI disclosure is also permitted as needed for treatment and for payment purposes. Some other exceptions are also possible (i.e. public health reporting). Always disclose the _minimum_ PHI necessary.

#### Case 

`Mr. G 36yo man with 3mo pregnant girlfriend. Mr. G contracted HIV via transactional sex and does not want you to tell girlfriend despite explanation or transmission risk and benefits of antiretroviral therapy.`
 
Conflict: confidentiality of Mr. G vs. non-maleficence toward girlfriend and fetus.

Resolution: report to public health reporting service and then council/persuade Mr. G to disclose his condition to girlfriend. Some confrontation might be appropriate - it is ok to voice your opinion.

`Ben 22yo med student, you are psychiatrist for Ben after breakup with Tina and ensuing mental breakdown. He threatens to kill Tina and you seek psychiatric interment but he later appears rational after hold and is not institutionalized.`

Conflict: confidentiality of Ben vs. saftey of Tina

Resolution: duty to warn applies if patient expresses intent/plan to commit immenent harm against a specific person.
