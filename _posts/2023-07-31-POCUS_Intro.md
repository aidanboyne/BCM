## POCUS Notes

#### Components of Ultrasound
 - Transducer: source of sound (ultrasound probe).
 - Compression and rarefaction: bunching and spreading of molecules in sound wave. One cycle consists of a compression and rarefaction.
 - Sound is a longitudinal wave
 - Frequency: cycles per second (Hz)
	- Infrasonic (<20Hz)
	- Audible (20-20k Hz)
	- Ultrasonic (>20k Hz): most cardiac probes between 2-10MHz
 - Period: time per cycle = 1/Frequency
 - Propogation speed: average in tissue is 1540m/s. Varies with density and stiffness
 - Wavelength: distance between 2 peaks or 2 valleys in cycle. Defined as speed/frequency
 - Echogenicity: brightness on ultrasound (how sound-reflective structure is)
	- Hypoechoic = less bright than other structure
	- Hyperechoic = brighter than other structure
	- Isoechoic = same
	- Anechoic = no internal signal

#### Principles and Mechanism
Shorter wavelength = better resolution. However shorter wavelengths do not penetrate deeply. Thus shallow structures (veins, arteries) will be visualized with high-frequency, short wavelength probes. Deep structures will use lower frequency probes.

Probes use piezoelectric elements to convert electricity to vibration which is transmitted via gel (which reduces impedance and improves skin contact) into tissue and reflected back based on:
1. Density
2. Distance
3. Scattering

Reflections are then converted back to signal sent to the computer.

Three assumptions are made:
1. Sound travels in straight line
2. Average speed is 1540m/s
3. Depth is determined by time from transducer to return

 
 #### Probe Choice
  - Curved array: deep structures, abdomen, and pelvis.
  - Linear array: superficial venous/arterial. Lung and neck scanning.
  - Phased array: cardiac scanning (fits between ribs)
  
 When scanning, stabilize your arm and hold probe like a pencil. The probe marker will correspond with a screen marker to indicate orientation. 
  - Indicator to head = slices along sagittal plane
  - Indicator to right side = slices along transverse plane 
  
 #### Interpretation
 Organs with singal tissue type are more homogenous than organs with multiple tissue types. Fluid filled organs (bladder/gallbladder/heart chambers) are often anechoic.
 
 Artifacts
  - Reverberation: repeating, equidistant parallel lines in lung, needles, breast implants, and some foreign objects.
  - Posterior shadow: strong reflectors such as bone, metal, and calcifications
  - Posterior Enhancement: bright area behind weak attenuator (i.e. bladder). Due to sound travelling relativley lossless through fluid.
  - Mirror image: posterior to strong reflector due to indirect echo path. Common at diaphragm
