**Goal**: To describe the interactions of viral pathogens and the human immune system, and the significance of these interactions in viral pathogenesis.

## COVID Diagnosis

### Presentation and Differential

Most patients with COVID present with one or more of the following:
* Fever or chills
* Sore throat
* Congestion or rhinorrhea
* Myalgias
* Headache
* Nausea or vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Cough
* Dyspnea
* Fatigue
* New-onset anosmia or ageusia

Most hospital admits are diagnosed with pneumonia with ground glass opacity on CT. Severe COVID can progress into ARDS and shock. Some uncommon complications include acute kidney or cardiac injury, secondary infection, and rhabdomyolysis. Development of disseminated intravascular coagulation due to unregulated complement activation is sign of very poor prognosis. Cytokine storm (primarily IL-6,10,2 and IFN-gamma) can cause severe vasoplegia and hypotension along with pulmonary edema and prolonged fever. Kidney involvement indicates very poor prognosis and is associated with predisposing factors such as sepsis, hypovolemia and other cardiovascular comorbidity.

Differentials include:
1. Influenza
2. Sjögren's syndrome
3. Acute Bronchitis

Lack of taste/smell are relatively specific to COVID, however. Travel is common way for new variants to spread and was critical to spread at early stages of pandemic. Less of a factor now unless traveling to place with known outbreak, though can be informative on what strain you may have contracted.

#### Microvasculature Complications [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050354)

Patients with severe COVID-19 often have laboratory findings consistent with a hypercoagulable state, suggesting widespread thrombosis and fibrinolysis, as well as elevated levels of D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and factor VIII. These patients also manifest a hyperinflammatory state, or “cytokine storm,” characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, which have been linked to severity of pneumonia and mortality. Release of VWF and P-selectin promote thrombosis which can cause capillary congestion that can exacerbates hypoxic cellular damage.

### Summary of Phases and Symptoms

## Lab Testing

### Sputum Culture

Ideal sputum culture (want from LRT not URT):
 - Abundant leukocytes
 - < 10 squamous epithelial cells
 - Numerous bacteria of single morphotype

Sputum is smeared and stained with Gram and or specific stains such as AFB (TB) or GMS (Fungal). Biochemical tests such as FTM, catalase, and oxidase can be preformed.  Virus testing via RT-PCR or NGS is also possible. If bacterial or fungal specimens are found, **antimicrobial susceptibility testing** is performed, typically by culturing the pathogen on agar or appropriate medium and then inserting discs of abx before incubation which will cause diffusion into agar and creating a zone of inhibition indicative of abx efficacy.

#### Antibiogram

The hospital antibiogram is a periodic summary of antimicrobial susceptibilities of local bacterial isolates submitted to the hospital's clinical microbiology laboratory. Antibiograms are often used by clinicians to assess local susceptibility rates, as an aid in selecting empiric antibiotic therapy, and in monitoring resistance trends over time within an institution. Antibiograms can also used to compare susceptibility rates across institutions and track resistance trends. They are usually generated by a laboratory using aggregate data from a hospital or healthcare system.

### Kidney Testing

**GFR Test**: Blood is taken and creatinine is measured. An equation involving age, blood creatinine, ethnicity, gender, height, and weight is then used to calculate an estimated GFR which indicates how well kidney filters the blood. Normal results are 90-120 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Results under 60 for 3+ months are indicative of CKD.

**Urine Albumin**: analyze urine for albumin/creatine ratio. Albumin should be completely filtered by kidney. A value of 30 or higher suggests you may be at a higher risk for kidney failure.

Routine monitoring of BUN and blood creatinine give kidney trends for in patient.

### RT-PCR

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). [_From Wikipedia_]

### Rapid Antigen Test (LFA)

Sample is combined with reagents that expose the protein of interest (in COVID this is the N protein or S protein). If the antigen is present, it will be trapped at the antibody line on the strip as it passes by and then lit up (fluorescent or colorimetric) by either sandwich or competitive probe binding.

Antigen tests cannot detect small amounts of virus or asymptomatic cases as well as PCR, however it is nearly 100% specific (less sensitive). Excellent PPV low NPV.

### Chest X-ray

No single feature of covid-19 pneumonia on a chest radiograph is specific or diagnostic, but a combination of multifocal peripheral lung changes of ground glass opacity and/or consolidation, which are most commonly bilateral, may be present. When there is a replacement of air with another substance in the lung, such as fluid or fibrosis, it causes an increase in the density of that area labeled "opacity".

## COVID Treatment

### Oxygen

* FiO2: Fraction of inspired oxygen (%).
* PaCO2: The partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood. It is used to assess the adequacy of ventilation.
* PaO2: The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood. It is used to assess the adequacy of oxygenation.
* SaO2: Arterial oxygen saturation measured from blood specimen.
* SpO2: Arterial oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry.

Generally, supplemental O2 only indicated for hypoxemia (O2sat < 86-90% on exertion). 

### Medications

#### Corticosteroids

**Glucocorticoid Receptor** [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279171/): nuclear receptor superfamily protein that mediates the diverse actions of glucocorticoids as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. This receptor is a protein that shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon binding to its ligand glucocorticoid hormone, where it modulates the transcription rates of glucocorticoid-responsive genes (3-10% of functional genome) positively or negatively. In pharmacologic doses, glucocorticoids are used as potent immunosuppressive agents in the therapeutic management of many inflammatory, autoimmune and lympho-proliferative diseases.

**Glucocorticoids** are secreted from adrenal glands at adrenal cortex under control of ACTH. Hypothalamus secretes CRH stimulating anterior pituitary ACTH release and resulting adrenocortical cell glucocorticoid release in zona fasciculata in negative feedback loop.

Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor and then enter nuclues and bind clucocorticoid response elements and transcribe mRNA. Examples of glucocorticoids include cortisol which has following effects:
 - anti-inflammitory via prostaglandin, leukotriene, and IL2 inhibition
 - lypolysis
 - proteolysis
 - insulin resistance (hyperglycemia)

Synthetic glucocorticoids increase circulating neutrophils by decreasing neutrophil attachment proteins (demargination) and reduce lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil counts. Methylprednisolone is a intermediate acting (12-36hr) glucocorticoid that can be taken PO or IV/IM/IA. It is used in covid to inhibit hyper-inflammatory response and preventing tissue damage that is primary cause of mortality in severe covid. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8956351/)

#### Empiric Abx

Empiric abx is medical treatment or therapy begun on the basis of a clinical "educated guess" of certain bacterial infection in the absence of complete or perfect information. This usually takes the form of broad spectrum abx (i.e. ampicillin). 

#### Remdesivir

Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug of an adenosine analog. It binds to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication by terminating RNA transcription prematurely.

Data shows that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

#### Monoclonal Abs

Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) are homogenous preparations of identical antibodies (or antibody fragments). Every antibody molecule in the product has the same antigen recognition site, affinity, biologic interactions, and downstream biologic effects. This distinguishes mAbs from polyclonal antibodies, which contain heterogenous protein sequences and recognize heterogeneous epitopes.

Four anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb products gainst the spike protein (bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, casirivimab plus imdevimab, sotrovimab, and bebtelovimab) have received Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld) received an EUA from the FDA that allowed this combination to be used as COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). These 2 recombinant human mAbs bind to nonoverlapping epitopes of the spike protein receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2.  However, these are not currently authorized as they are not shown to be effective against dominant variants. 

### Infectious Disease Referral

ID physicians specialize in care of long term infections and for rare infectious diseases. They advise on complicated infections and are advocates for the interventions of antibiotic stewardship programs. Uncommon infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites are often referred.

## General Science

### Viral Tropism [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3411105/)

_Tropism refers to the ability of a given pathogen to infect a specific location. Organ or tissue tropism reflects the ability of a given pathogen to infect a specific organ or sets of organs._

Factors influencing tropism include:
1. The presence of cellular receptors permitting viral entry via fusion with the plasma membrane or attachment and subsequent endocytosis.
2. Availability of transcription factors involved in viral replication.
3. The molecular nature of the viral tropogen or virus surface, such as the glycoprotein, which interacts with the corresponding cell receptor.

Tropism develops via infection of "target cell" and the acquiring a chunk of cell membrane when budding with new receptors for potentially infecting other cell types. For example, COVID can infect cells with ACE2 and HIV can infect cells with CD4 (macrophages and T-cells).



### COVID Infectious Cycle [[ref]](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-020-00703-5)
1. Extracellular SARS-CoV-2 contacts cell
2. Binding to ACE2 via spike (S) protein - high expression in kidney, heart, as well as in tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Also overexpressed in pts. with risk factors i.e. smoking, obesity, autoimmune disease...
    - Vimentin is critical co-receptor for ACE2 binding. Heparan sulfate enhances binding. May be inhibited by Heparin due to competitive inhibition.
3. TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane serine protease 2) priming
4. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (_Note_: Virion can alternativley directly fuse with plasma membrane via TMPRSS2 initiation, bypassing endosome process)
5. Uncoating, genomic RNA release and viral-protein synthesis in free and endoplasmic reticulum-attached ribosomes
    - Coronavirus genomic RNA encodes NSPs with role in viral RNA synthesis and structural proteins for virion assembly.
    - Polyproteins are cleaved and form Helicase or RNA replicase-transcriptase complex responsible for structural protein RNA replication (spike, envelope, and membrane)
    - Variants arise due to inexact RNA replication in error prone process allowing for small changes to structural and nonstructural proteins that can cause mAb resistance.
6. Vesicle-mediated exocytosis
7. Antigen presentation by endocytic compartments (MHC II) and proteasomes (MHC I)
8. Immune cell attraction and development of immunity or elimination of infected cells.

### Viral Replication Phase

#### Innate Immunity [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151814/#:~:text=The%20two%20major%20divisions%20of,and%20destroying%20virus%2Dinfected%20cells.)

Immediate response is thought to occur due to activation of Mannose-binding protein-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) along with some C3 activation causing complement system engagement.

![Complement System](/img/complement_pathways.png)

The innate immune defenses are initiated via pathogen recognition receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, especially TLR2 in COVID (expressed highly on dendritic, macrophage, lymphocytes, parenchymal cells) promoting type I (alpha/beta) IFN and inflammatory cytokines including IL1B, IL6, TNF-alpha, and IL-12. Alpha/beta IFNs bind type I FIN receptor and result in genes causing gene expression for 'antiviral state', NK activation, and IL-12 induction. COVID attempts to avoid innate immunity via IFN I and II restriction with NSPs.

NK cells promote inflammation, kill infected cells, release IFN-gamma, and interact with DC. NK lysis allow antigen (RNA) release into blood for recognition by adaptive immune system. NK do not kill uninfected cells due to high MHC I expression of `self` antigen while infected cells express positive viral antigen or fail to deliver self antigen.

Prolonged inflammation can result in severe complications such as lung damage, ARDS, organ failure, and death. Vascular issues can also occur. On infection, monocytes and subendothelial cells release factor VIIa and factor Xa. Leukocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets release proinflammatory cytokines and procoagulant microparticles, promoting increased leukocyte adhesion and decreased vasculo-protective molecules. These result in NETosis—the activation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps that recruit yet more inflammatory leukocytes and cytokines (Figure 2). Eventually this can lead to a loss of homeostasis and damaged microvasculature, called disseminated intravascular coagulation

#### Adaptive immunity [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9369212/#:~:text=Natural%20Killer%20Cells'%20Response%20to,of%20the%20adaptive%20immune%20system.)

The adaptive immune response takes at least five days to take effect . For COVID-19 it was found that antibodies are detectable approximately six days after RT-PCR detection of viral infection and are essential for viral clearance. Milder cases of COVID-19 generally take longer to show detectable levels of antibodies, with some being up to 28 days post RT-PCR confirmation of viral infection. The deadly cytokine storm that some severe cases of COVID-19 patients had was generally triggered about one week post infection.

#### Lymphoid Development

**T-cells**: Progenitor cells (HSC) in bone marrow initiate RAG 1 and RAG 2 becoming common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). They then migrate to thymus and mature via positive and negative selection. During the maturation process, T Cells acquire a receptor called TCR that recognizes a specific Ag. TCR is a multiprotein complex composed of two variable antigen-binding chains, αβ or γδ, which are associated with invariant accessory proteins (CD3γε, CD3δε, and CD247 ζζ chains) that are required for initiating signaling when TCR binds to an Ag which has been broken down and presented via MHC I (intracellular) or II (extracellular). αβ expressing cells eventually become CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells.

Cell activation and differentiation will only be sucessfull if three signals are present: i) interaction of the TCR with the peptide presented by the HLA molecule, ii) signaling through co-stimulatory molecules, and iii) participation of cytokines that initiate clonal expansion. In the lymph nodes, T Cells establish temporary contact with a great number of dendritic cells (DC) but only halt and bind to those which present an Ag which is compatible and specific to their receptor.

After Ag recognition, a complex signaling process is initiated on the internal side of the membrane and in the cytoplasm for the subsequent activation of three essential transcription factors: NFAT, AP-1, and NF-κB. The transcription factors NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-κB enter the nucleus and induce the transcription of genes to initiate the secretion of IL-2; the expression of its high affinity alpha receptor (IL-2Rα); the expression of integrins that promote cellular adhesion; the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD40L; and the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins.

IL-2 acts as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor. IL-2 activates blastogenesis or clonal expansion which gives rise to large numbers of T Cells with receptors identical to the original, able to recognize only the Ag that initiated its activation. Clonal expansion is followed by death phase where most (90%) of effector cells die.

If the T Cell expresses CD4, it is converted into a T-helper cell (Th) which has a double function: to produce cytokines and to stimulate B Cells to generate Abs.

![CD4+ Cells](/img/CD4_lineage.png)

When a CD8+ T Cell develops its effector functions, it is converted into a cytotoxic T Cell able to attack cells directly and destroy those that are malignant or infected with virus via liberation of cytotoxic granules (perforins and granzymes) or FasL (CD95). CD8+ T Cells also liberate IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.


**B-cells**: Same pathway up to CLP as T-cells. Unlike T-cells, B-cells lack Notch-1 signaling in bone marrow, causing B cell to remain in stromal cell microenvironment in bone marrow known as "niche". The cells go through the following phases:
- Early ProB: RAG1/2 expression that rearrange DJ segments and supress others via alleic exclusion
- Late ProB: VDJ recombinase joins V to DJ (heavy chain complete) and is bound to the constant region mu gene
- Large PreB: Tested to see if HC can bind to surrogate light chain (VpreB and lambda5) joined in vesicle and sent to cell surface near Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. If success, Ig-s send signal to nucleus for proliferation
- Small PreB: LC rearrangement (kappa first in iterative process until binds to HC or die, then lambda next) AIRE expression in bone marrow expresses antigens from throughout the body screens self-reactive B-cells and causes apoptosis to strong self binders. Intermediate binding causes LC rearrangement via splicing out VJ from LC over and over on both chromosomes first on kappa then lambda. Nonrecognizing move on to immature B-cells.
- Immature B-cell: BCR already has mu HC making it an IgM Ab, but alternative splicing causes some to start using IgD Ab.

Immature B-cells have unique DNA coding for BCR with light chain (LC) and heavy chain (HC) that binds to foreign antigens but is not self-reactive. The BCR has antigen binding site at tips of HC and LC. HC made of VDJ (44 variable, 27 diversity, 6 joining) while LC only has VJ (40 variable, 5 joining).

### Inflammation

Inflammation is the immune system's response to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, toxic compounds, or irradiation, and acts by removing injurious stimuli and initiating the healing process. In the case of covid, inflammation is triggered via PAMP binding and cytokine release.

Inflammation is described by 
1. Calor: heat
2. Dolor: pain
3. Rubor: redness
4. Tumor: swelling

And triggered by allergens, irritants, toxins, virulence factors, PAMPs, and internal DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns). Immune cells recognize PAMPs and DAMPs via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
 - Macrophages eat phagocytose pathogens and mast cells release inflammatory mediators
 - Cytokine and NO release increases vascular permeability increasing extracellular fluid
 - Leukocytes (esp. neutrophils) attracted by chemokines in complement system and microbial products and extravate into tissues. Complement system helps with opsonization facillitating pathogen destruction
 - Cytokines and low O2 tension cause local angiogenesis to provide cells and nutrients at inflammation site

Primary inflammatory stimuli, including microbial products and cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), mediate inflammation through interaction with the TLRs, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and the TNF receptor (TNFR). Receptor activation triggers important intracellular signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways.

 - NF-κB Pathway: induced by variety of intercellular inflammatory cytokines, pathogenic substances, and enzymes. Usually inhibited by IκB which gets phosphorlyated by IKK and subsequently degraded. This results in RelA-p50 transcription of inflammatory cytokines

 - MAPK pathway: serine/threonine protein kinase responding to osmotic stress, mitogen, heat shock and Il1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. Has MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPKK Kinsase (MAPKKK) and flows from MAPKKK --> MAPK which then activates transcription of inflammatory cytokine encoding genes.

 - JAK-STAT: direct IL-6 binding to transcriptional response of inflammatory cytokines via activation of receptor-associated JAK creating STAT transcription factor docking sites.

 #### Homeostasis [[ref]](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/pdf/S1097-2765(14)00263-9.pdf)
Cellular homeostasis maintains a number of regulated variables
including cell volume, osmolarity, electrolyte concentration (e.g.,
Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations), pH, membrane potential, and
concentrations of intracellular ions, proteins, nutrients, cholesterol, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
