## Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201631)

The typical prostate is 15-30mL, but no formal cutoff volume for BPH has been defined and the disorder is primarily diagnosed and treated to control symptoms which may vary between patients with similar sized prostates. BPH is **not** a risk factor for prostate cancer. 

![Prostate](/img/prostate.webp)
  _The prostate is composed of glandular peripheral, central, and transitional zones. The transitional zone is the principal site of BPH, while the peripheral zone is the most common site of prostate neoplasms (80%)._

The prostate is comprised of ducts and ascini embredded in stroma and includes luminal cells (columnar epithelial cells responsible for secretions), basal epithelium, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and neuroendocrine cells. The epithelial cells express high lelvels of androgen receptors, explaining the hormone dependent nature of both physiologic and neoplastic prostate tissue.

### Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)

Symptoms can be:
- **Obstructive**: urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining or prolonged voiding
- **Irritative**: increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence and reduced voiding volumes
- **Post-micutrition**: postvoid dribble and incomplete emptying

Complications of BPH include acute retention, UTI, bladder clculi, renal insufficiency, and hematuria.

#### Polyuria

Frequent urination (>3L/day in adults) is associated with a range of disorders including
- Central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
- Solute diuresis
  - Glucosuria in hyperglycemic diabetics
  - Urea diuresis in resolving AKI
  - Sodium diuresis with high IV saline or after b/l obstruction release
- Primary polydipsia

### Risk Factors

- Age: Prostate size increases at a median rate of 0.6mL/yr in most men. LUTS risk also increases with age.
- Meatbolic syndrome: Increases prostatic growth
- Low testosterone (seems a bit paradoxical as testosterone and its derivatives interact with the androgen receptor (AR), which upon binding translocates to the nucleus and binds to the androgen response element (ARE), promoting the expression of genes encoding various growth factors including keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs))
- Fatty diet

### Diagnosis

Detailed history to reveal other potential causes of LUTS (including comorbidities, medications, and fluid intake) followed by physical ruling out neurological issues, DRE, and uninalysis. Uroflowmetry (Qmax <10ml/s, ireegular flow pattern, and low volume voided) and PVR volume can confim obstructive symptoms (>200-300 suggestive of BPH but also attributable to poor detrusor function). 

Transrectual US can determine prostate size and find irregularites that would be concerning for cancer. The IPSS is a validated questionaire to evaluate symptoms with scores 1-7 being mild, 8-19 moderate, and 20-35 severe. High PSA levels are also correlated with large prostates

### Treatment
- IPSS < 8 + minimal bother: watchful waiting is reccomended. 

**Medical Options**

![Prostate Meds](/img/Prostate_meds.webp)

Examples of alpha1-adrenergic antagonists are tamsulosin, doxazosin, etc... Steroid 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are dutasteride and finasteride and have shown to slow progression of symptoms when combined with alpha1-adrenergic antagonists. PDE5i such as Tadalafil, muscarinic antagonists like solifenacine or tolterodine, and beta3-agonists such as mirabegron have also been trialed to some success.

**Surgical Options**
- Urolift: lateral compression of the prostate via a device allows for improvement of LUTS via widening of the urethral channel. It also preserves sexual function with a mild adverse-effect profile. However, it is a relativley new device without long term results.
- Debulking: Partial removal of the adenomatous tissue, typically via a transurethral route. Traditional resection uses monopolar diathermy, but bipolar, laser, microwave, and steam options now exist,
- Adenectomy: Full removal via enuclation of the adenoma off of it's capsule. Can be open, robotic, or laser.

## Prostate Cancers [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-020-00243-0)

Patients with localized disease at a low to intermediate risk of recurrence generally have a favourable outcome of 99% overall survival for 10 years if the disease is detected and treated at an early stage. As previously mentioned, the peripheral zone of the prostate makes up the majority of tissue and is the most common site of neoplasms.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after lung cancer and accounts for 7% of all incident cancers in men globally with a higher rate in developed regions.

### Risk
- **Age**: over 85% of newly diagnosed individuals are >60y.o.
- **Non-heritable**: Smoking and smoke exposure, obesity, and predominantly western diet
- African or Carribean descent
- Family history (stonger association than any other cancer)
- **BRCA2** and **HOXB13**: mutations in these genes confer 7-8 adn 3x risk respectivley.

### Screening

About 80% of men are diagnosed with organ-confined disease (99% 5 year survival), and only 5% are diagnosed with distant metasteses (30% 5 year survival). 

According to ACA reccomendations [[ref]](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html), discussions regarding PSA screening should start at:
* Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years
* Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African American men and men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65).
* Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age)

If no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test:

* Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years.
* Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher.

However, a meta-analysis of five randomized trials with follow-up periods ranging from 10 to 20 years, a prostate cancer mortality reduction was not found (relative risk 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.08) [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30185521/)


### Pathophysiology

The most commonly observed alterations linked to pathogenesis of localized prostate cancer are fusions of AR-regulated promoter regions with regions encoding members of the erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) family of transcription factors. Detailes of common genetic alterations are shown below:

![Prostate Genetics](/img/prostate_genetics.webp)

Common sites of metastatic spread in advanced prostate cancer include locoregional spread to lymph nodes (99%) and bone (84%). Uncommon sites of metastasis include distant lymph nodes (10.6%), viscera (~10%) and the brain and dura (<2%). Progression is accompanied by rising PSA levels, which suggests AR activity, owing to proliferation of luminal epithelial cells.

In addition, in an aggressive, rare variant of prostate cancer that typically lacks AR expression, termed poorly differentiated neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC; also known as small cell carcinoma), the most frequent alterations thought to be disease drivers are gene amplifications of AURKA and MYCN. This variant often occurs after androgen deprevation therapy for typical prostate adenocarcinoma.

By its definition, the transformed epithelium in prostate adenocarcinoma must possess the capacity to invade the basement membrane to be classed as cancerous. This BPH in which non-cancerous cell growth and proliferation occurs in the transition zone of the prostate. 

### Prognosis

Biopsy is **essential** for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Currently, transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsies are employed for systematic sampling of 10–12 cores for histopathological diagnosis. Other methods such as transperineal mapping biopsies or muliparametric MRI-guided biopsies are becoming preffered to TRUS.

The Gleason score is the most common grading system but it was reorganized into ISUP grades 1-5 (the WHO reccomended system). It consists of the summation of the most prominent and second most prominent Gleason pattern numbers, which results in a low (≤6), intermediate (7) or high (8–10) Gleason grade.

![Biopsy Grading](/img/Gleason.webp)

Most prostate cancers have conventional acinar morphology, but variant prostate cancer pathology, such as mucinous carcinoma and ductal adenocarcinoma, may also occur. Rarely, tumours may consist of neuroendocrine cells or myofibroblasts and are associated with poor survival.

### Treatment

Treatment of prostate cancer is dividied into local disease and relapsed disease which is subclassified as metastatic or non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC). Progression of CSPC with androgen deprevation therapy (ADT) indicates castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

![Treatment of PC](/img/Prostate_treatment.webp)

Active surveillance involves scheduled, predefined follow-up examinations using DRE, PSA measurement and repeat biopsy (mpMRI-guided), and is employed to reduce overtreatment in men with very low-risk prostate cancer. Watchful waiting is a reasonable palliative approach in patients with low-risk disease and a limited life expectancy (<10yrs). Radical local treatment (surgery or external beam radiotherapy) combined with ADT provides best outcomes in intermediate or high risk cases.

After radical prostatectomy, PSA levels upon ultra-sensitive PSA-testing should be undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml), whereas a PSA >0.1 ng/ml is a surrogate marker of prostate cancer residues. After radiotherapy, PSA levels do not return to undetectable levels as the prostate remains44. Rising PSA levels are seen in ~27–53% of patients after prostatectomy or radiotherapy and precedes metastatic progression which may be postponed or avoided by local salvage radiotherapy.

#### Metastatic Disease

Prostate cancer most commonly metastisizes to the pelvic lymph nodes and bone (where it forms blastic lesions in the pelvis, hip, and axial skeleton). It also can metastisize to distant lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and the brain, all of which are associated with poor survival.

- **Hormone-sensitive**: standard of care is surgical orchiectomy or systemic ADT with LHRH agonists given continously until further disease progression. High volume disease (Gleason score >= 8 + 3+ bone mets or a visceral met) should recive docetaxel +/- prednisolone.
- **Castration-resistant**: Despite good initial responses to systemic treatment, standard ADT or primary combination treatments for mCSPC eventually fail in nearly all patients. Nonetheless, ADT should be continued as it has some benefit in the castration-resistant stage. Taxane chemo, abiraterone and ezalutamide, immunogenic dentritic vaccines, Radium-223, PARPi, and PD1/PDL1 inhibitors have shown some success in certain cancers.

## Case Medications

- **Leuprolide**: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist which supresses the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland when administered continuously. This leads to a reduction in testosterone production by the testes, effectively creating a chemical castration.
- **Bicalutamide**: non-steroidal anti-androgen which competitively binds to androgen receptors in the prostate cancer cells, preventing the binding of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Bicalutamide is often used in combination with other anti-androgen therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer.
- **Immunotherapy** aims to stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Specific immunotherapies, such as Sipuleucel-T (Provenge), are approved for certain stages of prostate cancer,
  - Indications include metastatic or advanced prostate cancer that has progressed despite other treatments.
  - Contraindications include active autoimmune disorders or immunodeficiency conditions, as immunotherapy may exacerbate these conditions. Caution is also warranted in patients undergoing immunosupression or who have recived solid organ transplant.
- **Tamsulosin**: alpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist, also known as an alpha-blocker which relaxing the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing symptoms associated with BPH.
- **Finasteride**: 5-alpha reductase inhibitor which inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is primarily responsible for the growth of the prostate gland. Finasteride is typically recommended for larger prostates or in combination with other BPH medications.
