## Altered Mental Status

### Workup

The first step is to determine the timeline for the mental status change, and the circumstances surrounding it, such as medication/drug use or trauma. An acute alteration in mental status is a medical emergency that requires a prompt, standardized evaluation. Airway, breathing, and circulation (“ABC’s”) should be assessed in tandem with an updated set of complete vital signs and finger-stick blood glucose. Tachycardia may be a sign of systemic infection, pulmonary embolism, or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Hypoxemia and fever can each result in altered mental status and both shape the differential. Naloxone should be administered if there is a high index of suspicion for opiate overdose, which should not be overlooked in postoperative and hospitalized patients. If hypoglycemic, glucose should be administered, but only after thiamine supplementation to reduce the risk for developing Wernicke encephalopathy.

Other inital tests include electrolyte panel, CBC, urine toxicology, renal and liver funciton tests, urine analysis with culture, and chest radiograph if indicated.

If infection or lesion are suspected, CT and/or MRI Lumbar puncture should be preformed. Serum ammonia, thyroid funciton test, B12 levels, autoimmune serologies, and EEG (in suspicion of epileptic status) can also be ordered.

As nosocomial meningitis is uncommon, a lumbar puncture is most useful in patients who present to the emergency department with altered mental status, although it should still be considered in hospitalized patients with recent neurosurgery or skull fracture, medical devices or surgical hardware implanted in the central nervous system, or immunocompromise.

### Positive and Negative Psychotic Symptoms

The positive symptoms of psychosis include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior, and catatonia. These are caused by excess dopamine in the **mesolimbic pathway**. Negative symptoms include flat affect, amotivation, withdrawl, and cognitive dysfunction. These are cuased by dysfunction and low dopamine in the mesocortical pathway.

## Autoimmune Encephalitis

### Anti-NMDA Receptor Antibody Encephalitis [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495821/)

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a form of encephalitis occurring primarily in women and associated with antibodies against NR1 or NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor.

Common clinical features include auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions, behavioural change (frequently with agitation), impaired consciousness, motor disturbance (ranging from dyskinesia to catatonia), seizures, and autonomic dysfunction.

The disease is generally preceeded by a non-specific prodrome (headache, low-grade fever, poor concentration, slurred speech) which is followed by prominent psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, disinhibited/bizzare behavior, delusion, and audiovisual hallucinations. Cognitive delcine, motor dysfunction (especially epileptic seizure adn dyskinetic movement), and automomic instability (hypoventillation and dysrythmia) are other notable symptoms.

Diagnosis requires positive serum or CSF antibody test. Clinical symptoms correlate with the Ab titer. Other labs include lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased CSF protein, and oligoclonal bands. MRI is often normal (70%), though can display hyperintensities in hippocampi, cerebellar/cerebral coricies, basal ganglia, brainstem, and frontobasal/insular regions. EEG may show non-specific slowing or slow continuous rhythm in catatonic phase and can help distinguish between a primary psychiatric disorder.

### Differential
- Viral encephalitis, cerebral vasculitis or other forms of autoimmune encephalitis and encephalitis lethargica.
- Diskenetic movements may be mistaken for tardive dyskinesia.
- Psychiatric illness

### Treatment Options
- First line: corticosteroids, IVIg, PLEX and removal of any identified teratomas
- Second line: rituximab or cyclophosphamide, often required in delayed diagnosis or in those without an underlying ovarian teratoma.
- Behavioral and psychoitic symptoms can be managed by typical and atypical antipsychotics
- Catatonia can be managed with benzodiazepines, but there is limited evidence in anti-NDMA.

### Other Autoimmune Cuases
- **Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**: ADEM appears to be an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that is triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. The proposed mechanism is that myelin autoantigens, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, share antigenic determinants with those of an infecting pathogen. The disease consistes of a priming/activation phase and recruitment/effector phase. It is associated with coronavirus, coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex, hepatitis A, HIV, influenza, measles, rubella, varicella zoster, and West Nile virus. [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-adem-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis). Irratibility and confusion are common alongside sleepiness or coma.
- **VGKC Ab**: antibody against leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) targeting the limbic symptom causing memory deficits, cognitive issues, hyponatremia, and **_faciobrachial dystonic seizure_**. More common in men.
- **Anti-GABAR**, **Anti-AMPAR**, and **Bickerstaff's** are some other potential causes.

### Other causes of Encephalitis
- **Viral**:
    - _HSV-1_ (which normally causes cold sores) can spread to the brain parenchyma, potentially via the trigmenial nerve or olfactory tract. It classically affects the bilateral temporal lobes causing inflammationand hemorrhage. Kluver-Bucy syndrome, which is characterized by hypersexuality, hyperorality (placing inappropriate objects in the mouth), decreased sense of fear, and overeating, can occur if both lobes are invaded. Common sumptoms are seizure, memory issues, receptive aphasia, loss of smell, and hallucinations. 
    - _Arboviruses_ are most often spread by mosquitos and include Western/Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, Japanees enchephalitis, West Nile. West Nile can be distinguished due to the flaccid paralysis similar to polio. 
    - _Enteroviruses_ including rhinovirus and coxsackie more often cause meningitis and will usually occur with URI symptoms
    - _Rabies Virus_ travels through the peripheral nerves to the CNS and causes hydrophobia, extreme agitiation, abnormal grimasing, opisthotonos, and autonomic dysfunciton. Neurons will show Negri bodies. 
    - _Variciella-zoster and rubeola_ typically only causes skin rashes (chickenpox and measels respectivley) but can spread to the brain 1-14 days after rash onset. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may result in chronic progressive brain inflammtion 8-10 years after measels infection
    - _Coltivirus_ causes colorado tick fever. Encephalitis is accompanied by chills, aches, vomiting, and leukopenia.
- **Bacterial**
    - _Listera Monocytogenes_: cheese, cabbage, and deli. Initial presentation usually with gastroenteritis progressing to meningoencephalitis in neonates and in immunocompromised patients. CSF shows **gram-positive rods**
    - _Borrelia Burgdorferi_ causes Lyme disease and is transmitted by Ixodes deer tick bites. Meningitis, CN palsies, cerebellar ataxia, and motor/sensory ataxia are followed by encephalitis if not treated
    - _Chlamydophila psittaci_ causes walking pneumonia
    - _TB_ can causes granulomas in the brain
    - _Treponema Pallidum_ can result in neurosyphilis with granuloma formation in the brain if left untreated.
- **Parastic Causes**
    - _Acanthamoeba_: typically infects via the eye
    - _Naegleria fowleri_: typically via nasal exposure to warm freshwater. Rapidly fatal
    - _Trypanosoma brucei_: spread by the tsetse fly. Dramatic psychiatric symptoms

### Seizures in Autoimmune Encephalitis

Autoantibodies against surface antigens are hypothesized to directly mediate neurological changes that lead to acute symptomatic seizure development (by antigenic modulation or by recruitment of immune cells or complement activation). Therefore, cases with these antibodies are often reversible with good immunotherapy response and do not require lifelong ASM. The risk of AAE is generally higher in patients with intracellular neuronal antibodies (suspected to be a T cell mediated process) than in those with cell surface antibodies (often directly pathogenic). However, in experimental animal models, autoantibodies against surface antigens have exhibited robust effects on the target proteins, resulting in hyperexcitability and impairment of synaptic function and plasticity, leading to ASSAE [[ref]](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00175-0/fulltext)

## Parmacology
- **Quetiapine**: atypical antipsychotic approved for schizophrenia, acute mania, and as an adjunctive treatment for MDD. It has also been used in GAD. 
    - 5-HT2 receptor antagonist
    - D2 receptor antagonist (at mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways) 
- **Lacosamide**: antiepileptic used to treat partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
    - Selective enhancment of low inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels stablizing hyperexcitable neurons by inducing a hyperpolarized state
- **Lorazepam**: short-acting benzodiazepine for short-term anxiety releif. Also used for tranquilization of agitated patients, alcohol withdrawl, and psychogenic catatonia.
    - GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel agonist in the CNS causing hyperpolarization of CNS neurons and stabilization of the cellular plasma membrane. 
- **Plasma Exchange (PLEX)**: plasma exchange removes large-molecular-weight substances from the plasma, including antibodies, complement components, immune complexes, endotoxin, lipoproteins, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers
- **IVIG**: In general, high-dose IVIG paradoxically leads to a reversal of their effects, as opposed to their actions at replacement doses, resulting in a more immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory phenotype.
    - Saturation of FcgRs
    - Inhibition of monocyte and macrophage activation
    - Induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines from innate cells and decreased responsiveness to IFN
    - Expansion of T-reg population
- **Rituximab**: monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that binds primarily to pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes promoting lysis.
- **Methylprednisolone**: corticosteroid used to downregulate inflammatory and/or immune reactions.
    - Higher potency than prednisone
    - Decrease vasodilation, capillary permeability, leukocyte migration, and other inflammatory reactions via downregulation of NF-KB mediated transcription.

## Case Specifics
- **SSHADESS Exam**: Strengths, school, home, activities, drugs, emotions, sexuality, saftey. Designed for direct questioning of an adolescent in a private setting.
- **Video EEG**: Video monitoring + EEG. EEG uses the principle of differential amplification, or recording voltage differences between different points using a pair of electrodes that compares one active exploring electrode site with another neighboring or distant reference electrode. Only through measuring differences in electrical potential are discernible EEG waveforms generated. By convention, when the active exploring electrode is more negative than the reference electrode, the EEG potential is directed above the horizontal meridian, whereas if the opposite is true, where the reference electrode is more negative, the EEG potential vector is directed below the horizontal meridian.
- **ICU Delerium**: The most frequent presentation in critical care is when patients move between the two states – from agitated, hyperactive behaviour to becoming sleepy and unresponsive. They can also be easily distracted, so will have difficulty taking in information or understanding what is being said. They may be forgetful and feel disorientated. They may have difficulty making judgements, have incoherent speech (rambling), or be unable to recognise spaces or shapes. Some patients may hallucinate or have delusions. The deterioration of mental faculties might affect their understanding of their surroundings and situation, which can make it very frightening for them.
- **Texas Driving Law**: According to guidance issued by the Texas Medical Advisory Board, those with ongoing or uncontrolled seizures are prohibited from driving; for a “P” restriction for a class C license, applicants must be seizure free for three months; and for a class A or B license, the applicant must be seizure free for five years while off anti-seizure medication.
