## Insulin and Glucose Regulation [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201519)

Following a meal, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited by the combined actions of hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. Approximately 60–70% of insulin secretion is dependent on the release of the incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) by the L cells and the K cells in the gut, respectively. Collectively, the changes in glucose, insulin and glucagon levels suppress hepatic glucose production, stimulate muscle glucose uptake and inhibit lipolysis; the latter results in a reduction in the free fatty acid concentration in blood, which further enhances the effect of insulin on the liver and muscle. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with major disturbances in all of the preceding physiological responses: insulin secretion is impaired; fasting plasma glucagon levels are increased and fail to suppress normally after a meal; basal hepatic glucose production is increased and fails to suppress normally after a meal; muscle glucose uptake is impaired; fasting plasma free fatty acid levels are increased and fail to suppress normally following a meal; and the post-meal rise in GLP1 and GIP is normal or modestly decreased. However, there is severe β-cell resistance to the stimulatory effect of both GLP1 and GIP on insulin secretion.

### Ominous octed of hyperglycemia

Insulin resistance in muscle and the liver, and impaired insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells are the core defects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). β-cell resistance to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) contributes to progressive failure in the function of β-cells, whereas increased glucagon levels and enhanced hepatic sensitivity to glucagon contribute to the excessive glucose production by the liver. Insulin resistance in adipocytes results in accelerated lipolysis and increased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, both of which aggravate the insulin resistance in muscle and the liver and contribute to β-cell failure. Increased renal glucose reabsorption by the sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) and the increased threshold for glucose spillage in the urine contribute to the maintenance of hyperglycaemia. Resistance to the appetite-suppressive effects of insulin, leptin, GLP1, amylin and peptide YY, as well as low brain dopamine and increased brain serotonin levels contribute to weight gain, which exacerbates the underlying resistance. To the ‘ominous octet’ must be added vascular insulin resistance and inflammation, making the ‘decadent decoplet’. 

### Pancreas Physiology

In human islets, β-cells constitute ∼60% of cells and are intermingled with glucagon-producing α-cells (30%), somatostatin-producing δ-cells (10%) and pancreatic polypeptide-producing cells (1%). Within the islet, β-cells form sparse subclusters, which show functional connectivity through gap junctions67. Each islet contains 100–500 μU of insulin, so that the whole endocrine pancreas (∼1 million islets, weighing 0.9 g) contains 10 days’ worth of supply for a healthy adult. β-cells communicate with each other and with the other islet endocrine cells through connexin proteins and other cell–cell adhesion complexes. In post-mortem specimens from patients with T2DM, β-cell mass is reduced by 30–40% compared with specimens from non-diabetic subjects.

Insulin resistance is a major factor contributing to TD2M pathology; a lean, insulin-sensitive adult might need as little as 0.5 U of insulin to dispose of an oral load of 75 g of glucose over 2 hours, whereas an obese, insulin-resistant, glucose-intolerant person might require 45 U to perform the same task (∼90-fold inter-individual difference). T2DM also demonstrates a reduced response to glucose loads.

# Type II Diabetes [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201519)

In the liver, insulin resistance, together with insulin deficiency, hyperglucagonaemia, enhanced glucagon sensitivity and increased substrate (fatty acids, lactate, glycerol and amino acids) delivery, leads to increased gluconeogenesis, which is responsible for the increased basal rate of glucose production and fasting hyperglycaemia.

Binding of insulin to its receptor activates insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and phosphorylation of a family of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs), especially IRS1 and IRS2. These phosphorylated IRS proteins bind to and activate intracellular signalling molecules, most important of which is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K promotes glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane, resulting in glucose uptake into skeletal muscle, and phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), altering transcription of downstream genes. Insulin resistance is usually associated with increased serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, which inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to insulin resistance.

### Diganostic criteria

![T2DM](/img/T2DM_dxcriteria.png)

Annual conversion rates of prediabetes to T2DM range from 3% to 11% per year. At the time of diagnosis, many patients with T2DM are asymptomatic, whereas others present with severe hyperglycaemia or even diabetic ketoacidosis. The 2-hour post-glucose-load glucose level of 140–199 mg per dl (IGT) is the most-studied marker for future diabetes risk, and essentially all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have evaluated the efficacy of interventions for diabetes prevention have been performed in patients with IGT.

#### Risk factors

Increasing adiposity, as reflected by higher BMI levels, is the single most important risk factor for T2DM. In addition, particular dietary components are associated with a reduced risk of T2DM, independent of body weight, including higher intake of whole grains, green leafy vegetables, nuts and coffee; lower intake of refined grains, red and processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages; and moderate intake of alcohol. Physical inactivity is a key behavioural risk factor, and both aerobic activity and resistance training are beneficial. Sedentary behaviour, such as prolonged television watching, is associated with increased risk. Both short (≤5 hours per night) and long (≥9 hours per night) duration of sleep are associated with increased risk, as is rotating shift work. In addition, cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for developing T2DM, independent of body weight and other risk factors. Although genetics play an important part in the development of T2DM, the ongoing diabetes epidemic cannot be explained by novel genetic mutations but is instead largely explained by the epidemic of obesity. In summary, up to 90% of T2DM cases are potentially preventable by following a healthy diet, maintaining a BMI of ≤25 kg per m2, exercising for at least 30 minutes per day, avoiding smoking and consuming alcohol in moderation. The strongest genetic risk factor is a SNP in TCF7L2

### Treatment

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Consensus Conference10 recommended that high-risk individuals (HbA1c >6.5%; BMI ≥30 kg per m2; age ≤60 years) with IGT or IFG levels be treated with metformin. Pioglitazone and combined low-dose metformin and rosiglitazone12 also are very effective in preventing the conversion of prediabetes to diabetes. Lifestyle intervention is not effective long term in most patients, but can work if patients maintain weight loss and physical activity.

Ideally, HbA1c should be reduced to as close to normal without causing adverse effects, of which hypoglycaemia is the greatest concern. Patients with T2DM with HbA1c levels persistently <6.5% do not develop retinopathy. Because obesity and physical inactivity are insulin-resistant states associated with tissue fat overload (lipotoxicity), lifestyle modification should be a basic component of all intervention programmes.

- **Metformin**: supresses hepatic glucose production without any effect on beta-cell function.
- **Insulin Secretagogues**: Sulfonylureas augment insulin secretion via binding SUR component of K-ATP channels on beta-cell membranes. Metglitinides bind to a different site also causing K-ATP channels to close with a shorter lasting effect but less chance of hypoglycemia, especially after meals due to their somewhat glucose dependent effects. 
- **Insulin Sensitizers**: Thiazolidinediones (-glitazones) enhance insulin action via stimulation of intracellular signalling pathways.
- **GLP-1 Modulators**: DPP4 inhibitors (-gliptins) prolong endogenous GLP1 with modest effects on HbA1c but an excellent saftey profile. GLP-1 receptor agonists (-natides, -glutides) markedly augment insulin and decrease glucagon with durable and significant HbA1c reduction. They also delay gastric emptying, correct endothelial dysfunciton, and promote weight loss with strong evidence of cardiovascular and renal benefit.

# Type I Diabetes [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201716)

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia), which are due to the insulin deficiency that occurs as the consequence of the loss of the pancreatic islet β-cell. In the vast majority of patients (70–90%), the loss of β-cells is the consequence T1DM-related autoimmunity (concomitant with the formation of T1DM-associated autoantibodies); these patients have autoimmune T1DM (also known as type 1a diabetes mellitus). In a smaller subset of patients, no immune responses or autoantibodies are detected, and the cause of β-cell destruction is unknown (idiopathic T1DM or type 1b diabetes mellitus); this type has a strong genetic component.

![T1DM patho](/img/T1dm_cells.webp)

Characteristic autoantibodies associated with T1DM are those that target insulin, 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65; also known as glutamate decarboxylase 2), insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2) or zinc transporter 8 (ZNT8). Genetic risk factors include HLA-DR and -DQ genotypes. The disease progresses as shown below:

![T1DM Progression](/img/t1dm_prog.webp)

T1DM is usually diagnosed during stage 3 as shown above, at which point the disease may have progressed to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition. 

Only about 10% of diabetes is T1DM, but it is the most common form of diabetes in children. Incidence is highest in scandinavian and european countries and rarest in Asian countries. Peak incidence occurs at 12-14 years. Diagnosis of T1DM in adults is challenging, as it must be distinguished from T2DM.


### Diagnostic criteria

The 2016 American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus are based on signs of abnormal glucose metabolism, regardless of the diabetes type and the age of onset. See section on T2DM for criteria.

### Treatment

Management of T1DM in the past two and a half decades since the DCCT study has focused on intensive insulin therapy with the goal of maintaining glucose levels as close to normal as possible and avoiding hypoglycaemia. The DCCT was a landmark study; it showed that intensive glycaemic control was able to maintain a mean HbA1c level of 7.2% (as compared with conventional management for which the mean HbA1c level was 9.1%), and reduced microvascular complications by 35–76% during the trial and macrovascular complications by 58% during the passive follow-up in the EDIC study [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2882967/).

Current insulin administration is designed to most closely approximate the normal physiological setting, in which the pancreas continuously secretes a small amount of insulin and produces larger amounts in response to a meal containing carbohydrates. Accordingly, a combination of long-acting and short-acting insulin analogues is now used in the form of multiple daily insulin injections; after stabilization, an insulin pump can be used. 

#### Rapid-Acting Insulin
- **Examples**: Insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (NovoLog), insulin glulisine (Apidra)
- **Onset**: 15 minutes
- **Peak**: 1-2 hours
- **Duration**: 3-5 hours
- **Indications**: Mealtime insulin to control blood sugar spikes after meals. Often used in combination with longer-acting insulin.

#### Short-Acting (Regular) Insulin
- **Examples**: Regular insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R)
- **Onset**: 30 minutes
- **Peak**: 2-3 hours
- **Duration**: 5-8 hours
- **Indications**: Used for mealtime blood sugar control; can be administered 30 minutes before meals. Also used in insulin pumps.

#### Intermediate-Acting Insulin
- **Examples**: NPH insulin (Humulin N, Novolin N)
- **Onset**: 2-4 hours
- **Peak**: 4-12 hours
- **Duration**: 12-18 hours
- **Indications**: Often used twice daily to help control blood sugar levels overnight, in the morning, or between meals.

#### Long-Acting Insulin
- **Examples**: Insulin glargine (Lantus, Basaglar), insulin detemir (Levemir), insulin degludec (Tresiba)
- **Onset**: 1-2 hours
- **Peak**: Peakless
- **Duration**: Up to 24 hours or more
- **Indications**: Provides all-day blood sugar control. Can be used once or twice daily depending on the specific product and patient needs.

#### Ultra-Long-Acting Insulin
- **Examples**: Insulin degludec (Tresiba)
- **Onset**: Several hours
- **Peak**: Peakless
- **Duration**: Over 42 hours
- **Indications**: Provides steady insulin level for more than one day, offering flexible dosing times with less risk of hypoglycemia.

#### Premixed Insulin
- **Examples**: Various combinations of NPH and regular or rapid-acting insulin (e.g., NovoLog Mix 70/30, Humalog Mix 75/25)
- **Indications**: Designed for patients who prefer not to mix insulins themselves. Contains a mix of fast-acting and intermediate-acting insulin, covering both mealtime and basal needs.

#### Inhaled Insulin
- **Examples**: Afrezza
- **Onset**: Within 12 minutes
- **Peak**: ~1 hour
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Indications**: Rapid-acting insulin used at the beginning of meals for adults with diabetes.

# Diabeteic Complications

Hyperglycaemia promotes the development of microvascular complications through the activation of six major pathways, including enhanced polyol pathway flux, increased formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), increased AGE receptor expression, activation of PKC isoforms, enhanced hexosamine flux and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species. T2DM also affects the macrovasculature, and the incidence of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and stroke is markedly increased. Reactive oxygen species impair angiogenesis, activate several pro-inflammatory pathways and cause epigenetic changes that result in long-lasting expression of pro-inflammatory genes that persists after glycaemia is normalized. These same biochemical and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the microvascular complications also contribute to the macrovascular complications. [[ref]](https://doi.org/10.2337/diabetes.54.6.1615)

### Microvascular complications [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4952418/)

#### Diabetic Retinopathy

The most common cause of visual loss in working-age adults in the developed world. It occurs following hyperglycaemia-mediated damage within the retinal microvasculature. This damage causes basement membrane thickening, increased capillary permeability and the formation of microaneurysms. These changes lead to intravascular coagulation, resulting in retinal ischaemia which drives the formation of new vessels within the retina (neovascularisation). These new vessels are fragile and may rupture causing retinal bleeds. Furthermore, the lack of lymphatic drainage within the retina causes fluid accumulation in the presence of hyperglycaemia resulting in macular oedema.

![DB retina](/img/db_retinopathy.jpg)

#### Diabetic Nephropathy

Increased glomerular filtration pressures due to selective glycosulation and damage of efferent glomerular arterioles result in albuminuria, a driver for ongoing renal damage. Microalbuminuria is the first step towards developing overt proteinuria, but only 20% of patients with the condition progress towards proteinuric nephropathy. Proteinuric nephropathy continues to have a poor prognosis, with most patients dying from cardiac disease or progressing to end-stage renal failure. Aggressive blood pressure reduction is of vital importance in managing diabetic nephropathy. Individuals with microalbuminuria need to have BP ≤=125/75

#### Diabetic Neuropathy

Diabetic neuropathy refers to a spectrum of various neurological disorders associated with diabetes. Rarely, hyperglycaemia can induce an acute neuropathy that is reversible when glycaemic control is improved, but neuropathy is usually persistent. The most common form is a distal, symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy which may be asymptomatic in up to 50%. The spectrum can include a wide range of clinical syndromes including cranial nerve palsies, mononeuropathies and autonomic dysfunction. The main sequel of neuropathy is foot deformity, ulceration and Charcot arthropathy. The combination of neuropathy, arteriopathy and infection are the driving factors behind most diabetic foot amputations.

![DB neuropathy](/img/db_neuropathy.jpg)

### Macrovascular complications

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause (∼70%) of death in people with type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes have a 4-fold-greater risk for having a CVD event than people without diabetes after controlling for traditional risk factors for CVD, such as age, obesity, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Diabetes adversely affects the circulation by increasing the risk of atherosclerosis throughout the vasculature.
- 5-fold risk for first MI
- 2-fold risk for recurring MI
- 2 to 4-fold risk of ischemic stroke
- 15-fold risk of lower-extremity amputation (due to neuropathy and peripheral artery disease)

![DM Thrombosis](/img/DM_thrombotic.jpg)

## Case Drugs

* **Rosuvastatin**: statin medication that works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This leads to decreased cholesterol production, specifically lowering LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.
* **Metformin**: antidiabetic medication that decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It primarily targets the liver and does not stimulate insulin secretion.
* **Lisinopril**: ACE inhibitor (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitor) that works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This results in vasodilation, reduced blood volume, and ultimately lower blood pressure. It also reduces the degradation of bradykinin, contributing to its blood pressure-lowering effects.
* **Glyburide**: sulfonylurea antidiabetic drug that stimulates insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas. It binds to and closes potassium channels on the beta cell membrane, leading to cell depolarization, calcium influx, and subsequent insulin release.
* **Empagliflozin**: SGLT2 inhibitor (Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 inhibitor) that works by blocking glucose reabsorption in the kidney, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine and reduced blood glucose levels.
* **Semaglutide**: GLP-1 receptor agonist (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist) that mimics the action of the endogenous hormone GLP-1. It enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying to decrease blood glucose levels.
* Baby aspirin: low-dose aspirin works as an antiplatelet agent by irreversibly inhibiting COX-1 (Cyclooxygenase-1) enzyme, which results in the decreased formation of thromboxane A2, a molecule that promotes platelet aggregation. This reduces the formation of blood clots and is used for the prevention of cardiovascular events.
