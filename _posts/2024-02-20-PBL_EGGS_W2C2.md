## Terminology

1. **Hematemesis**: Vomiting of blood, indicating bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
    - Bright blood indicates high volume or proximal bleed
    - "Coffee-grounds" emesis indicates less blood or a more distal bleed
2. **Melena**: Black, tarry stools indicating bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, where blood has been digested.
3. **Hematochezia**: Passage of fresh, red blood through the anus, typically indicating bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal tract.
4. **Spider Angiomas:**: Spider angiomas result from the dilation of small blood vessels called arterioles in the skin's superficial layers. This dilation is often caused by elevated levels of estrogen, which can occur in various conditions such as liver disease (especially cirrhosis), pregnancy, or certain hormonal treatments. In liver disease, the impaired metabolism of estrogen leads to its accumulation, contributing to the development of spider angiomas.
5. **Caput Medusae:**:develops as a consequence of portal hypertension, a condition characterized by increased pressure within the portal venous system. Portal hypertension commonly arises from liver cirrhosis, where scar tissue formation disrupts normal blood flow through the liver. As a result, blood finds alternative routes to bypass the liver, such as through collateral veins. In the case of caput medusae, portal hypertension causes dilation of the umbilical veins and their surrounding collateral vessels. 

# Upper GI Bleed

### Diagnosis

More common than lower GI bleeding. Erosive lesions such as gastric/duodenal ulcers, esophagitis, and gastritis are more common than other etiologies such as vascular lesions (varicies, angiodysplaysia), mass lesions (adnenocarcinoma, polyps) or trauma (Mallory-Weiss) [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults). Detailed PMH may reveal:

* Varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy in a patient with a history of liver disease or excess alcohol use
* Aorto-enteric fistula in a patient with a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or an aortic graft
* Angiodysplasia in a patient with renal disease, aortic stenosis, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
* Peptic ulcer disease in a patient with a history of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) use, antithrombotic use, or smoking
* Malignancy in a patient with a history of smoking, excess alcohol use, or H. pylori infection
* Marginal ulcers (ulcers at an anastomotic site) in a patient with a gastroenteric anastomosis

Symptoms may help reveal etiology. Characteristic symptoms are as follows:

* Peptic ulcer – Upper abdominal pain
* Esophageal ulcer – Odynophagia, gastroesophageal reflux, dysphagia
* Mallory-Weiss tear – Emesis, retching, or coughing prior to hematemesis
* Variceal hemorrhage or portal hypertensive gastropathy: Jaundice, abdominal distention (ascites)
* Malignancy – Dysphagia, early satiety, involuntary weight loss, cachexia

Physical exam will reveal resting tachycardia. Significant blood loss will cause orthostatic or even supine hypotension. Lab tests should include CBC, CMP, LFTs, and coagulation studies. The bleeds present as hematemesis. Red blood suggests more severe bleeding than coffee-ground emesis. Melena is another possible symptom. Most bleeds are proximal to the ligament of Treitz (which suspends deodenal-jejunal flexure).

Endoscopy is diagnositc modality of choice. It has high sensitivity and specificity for locating lesions and can also treat lesions.

### Management

Patients should be assessed for hemodynamic stability. Unstable patients need IV access and immediate fluid resuscitation. Tranfusion may be required, espeically in patients with low hemoglobin. Active bleeds may require transfusion before labs return. Anticoagulants may need to be reversed, but endoscopy can generally be preformed anyways. Medications should be administered as follows:

1. PPIs: generally advised IV q12hr. Shown to reduce risk of ulcer rebleeding and reduce LOS.
2. Erythromycin may be used prior to endoscopy to improve visualization (it is a prokinetic)
3. Vasoactive compounds such as terlipressin (preferred) or octoreotide are good for variceal bleeding. 
4. Cirrhotic patients should recive prophylactic antibiotics based on current evidence [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults)

Variceal hemorrhage can be controlled medically (as discussed later) or via balloon tamponade if the bleeding is uncontrollable as a temporary treatment. Definitive treatment such as endoscopic ligations/ablations, transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, or surgery are then often administered. [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage?topicRef=2548&source=see_link)
- Ligation (EVL): placing of small elastic bands around varicies in distal esophagus
- Sclerotherapy (ES): sclerosant solution is injected, sealing the varicele. More complications than EVL
- TIPS: used after failure to stop bleed or rebleeding after endoscopic therapy. A needle catheter is passed to the hepatic vein via the jugular and wedged in place. The needle then is extended through the parenchyma to the portal vein and a stent is deployed, creating a hepatic-portal vein shunt. Highly effective and may also improve liver outcomes. However, TIPS is absolutley contraindicated in heart failure, polycystic liver disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, uncontrolled systemic infection or sepsis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation.
- Emergency surgery is highly effective but has a high mortality rate due to liver failure and surgical complications. Options include the creation of several different shunts, esophageal transection, or devascularization.

#### Peptic Ulcer disease
- H. Pylori infection (makes mucous layer more suceptible to acid damage), NSAIDs (local effects and systemic prostaglandin inhibition), stress, and excess gastric acid (i.e zollinger-ellison syndrome) are key risk factors. H. Pylori has better outcomes.

#### Esophagitis
- GERD or use of certain pills (NSAIDS, bisphosphinates, tetracycline, iron...), infection with candida or HSV all risk factors. Hematemisis is common and melena less so. Often benign course of UGIB.

#### Gastritis and Duodenitis
- Typically not a cause of UGIB unless anticoagulation or coagulopathy is coincident. Warrants further examination for missed lesions. Gastritis may be caused or enhanced by protal hypertension. Bleeding is often self limited and may be managed with removal of anticoagulant and addition of PPI.

#### Vascular lesions
- Dieulafoy's (aberrant submucosal vessel eroding epithelium in absence of primary ulcer) and GAVE (watermelon stomach from ectatic and sacculated mucosal vessels) are possible causes of bleeding, though rare. Angiodysplasias are also potential causes that may need imaging or surgery for diagnosis.

#### Mallory-Weiss
- Longitudinal mucosal lascerations in distal esophagus and proximal stomach associated with foreful retching (acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure), especially in the context of hiatal hernia (Cameron lesions). Most tears heal spontaneously and are not emergent, but some may require transfusion.

#### Other
- Foreign body ingestion
- Post-surgical anastomotic bleeding
- Post-polypectomy bleeds
- Post-sphinctterectomy bleeds
- Upper GI tumors (adenocarcinomas, GI stromal tumors, Kaposi sarcomas)
- Hemobilia (from hepatobiliary tract)
- Hemosuccus pancreatiucs (from pancreatic duct)

## Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension

Cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and the formation of regenerative nodules. It is generally considered to be irreversible in its advanced stages, at which point the only option may be liver transplantation. In earlier stages, specific treatments aimed at the underlying cause of liver disease may improve or even reverse cirrhosis. Along with variceal hemorrhage, other complications include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy and carcinoma, and hepatorenal/pulmonary syndromes.

The liver sustains the greatest degree of tissue injury by heavy drinking because it is the primary site of ethanol metabolism. Chronic and excessive alcohol consumption produces a wide spectrum of hepatic lesions, the most characteristic of which are steatosis, hepatitis, and fibrosis/cirrhosis. Steatosis is the earliest response to heavy drinking and is characterized by the deposition of fat in hepatocytes. Steatosis can progress to steatohepatitis, which is a more severe, inflammatory type of liver injury. This stage of liver disease can lead to the development of fibrosis, during which there is excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. The fibrotic response begins with active pericellular fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis, characterized by excessive liver scarring, vascular alterations, and eventual liver failure.

![ALD Progression](/img/ALD_progression.jpg)

Portal hypertension can also occur in the absence of cirrhosis, a condition referred to as "noncirrhotic portal hypertension." Causes of noncirrhotic portal hypertension include portal vein thrombosis, schistosomiasis, and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Additionally, portal hypertension and associated variceal bleeding can occur as a result of thrombosis of mesenteric vessels. [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults)

Not all UGIBs in patients with portal hypertension are variceal - up to 40% are unrelated and must be kept on the differential until proven otherwise.

### TIPS

Used after failure to stop bleed or rebleeding after endoscopic therapy. A needle catheter is passed to the hepatic vein via the jugular and wedged in place. The needle then is extended through the parenchyma to the portal vein and a stent is deployed, creating a hepatic-portal vein shunt. Highly effective and may also improve liver outcomes. However, TIPS is absolutley contraindicated in heart failure, polycystic liver disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, uncontrolled systemic infection or sepsis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Endoscopic Band Ligation

![BandLigation](/img/band_ligation.jpg)

### LFTs

1. **Total Bilirubin:**
   - Total bilirubin represents the overall amount of bilirubin in the blood, including both indirect (unconjugated) and direct (conjugated) bilirubin.
   - Elevated levels can indicate liver dysfunction, bile duct obstruction, or increased breakdown of red blood cells.

2. **Indirect Bilirubin:**
   - Indirect bilirubin, also known as unconjugated bilirubin, is the form of bilirubin that is insoluble in water and not yet processed by the liver.
   - Elevated levels suggest increased bilirubin production or impaired liver uptake or conjugation.

3. **Direct Bilirubin:**
   - Direct bilirubin, also called conjugated bilirubin, is the water-soluble form of bilirubin that has been processed by the liver and conjugated with glucuronic acid.
   - Elevated levels indicate impaired liver excretion or bile duct obstruction.

4. **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase):**
   - AST is an enzyme found predominantly in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidneys.
   - Elevated levels are seen in liver injury or inflammation, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, but can also occur in conditions affecting other organs like myocardial infarction or muscle injury.

5. **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):**
   - ALT is an enzyme found primarily in the liver.
   - Elevated levels are more specific to liver injury than AST and are commonly used as a marker of hepatocellular damage, such as in hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total Bilirubin   | Elevated in liver dysfunction, bile duct obstruction, or increased RBC breakdown |
| Indirect Bilirubin| Elevated in increased bilirubin production or impaired liver uptake/conjugation  |
| Direct Bilirubin  | Elevated in impaired liver excretion or bile duct obstruction                   |
| AST                | Elevated in liver injury, inflammation, myocardial infarction, or muscle injury  |
| ALT                | Elevated specifically in hepatocellular damage, such as hepatitis or fatty liver |

# Lower GI Bleed

Bleeds in the lower GI tract typically present with Hematochezia. 

### Evaluation
- **History**: past GI bleeds, medication use (NSAIDs, anticoags, antiplatlets), pain, changes in bowel habits. 
- **PE**: hypovolemia may result in tachycardia, orthostatic, or supine hypotension. Abdominal pain indicates inflammatory source of bleeding such as ischemic/infectious colitis or a perforation.
- **Labs**: BCB, CMP, LFTs, and coag studies needed. Hemoglobin levels should be monitored.

Note that 10-15% of patients with severe hematochezia actually have upper GI bleeds. Blood clots in the stool decrease this probability. High suspicion should be followed with endoscopy.

### Differential [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults)
- **Anatomic**: diverticulosis is thought to be the most common source of LGIBs. It occurs when sac-like protrusions of colonic wall allow penetration of thickened vessels which rupture in to the lumen. Though left diverticula are more common, right-sided diverticula are more likley to bleed. Bleeds may be massive and have high rates of long-term rebleeding. Bleeding is painless except colonic spasum due to intraluminal blood which may or may not be present. Risk factors include NSAIDs, asprin, age, obesity, inactivity, ischemic heart disease, renal insufficiency, and hyperlipidemia. 
- **Vascular**: angiodysplasia refers to dilated submucosal vessels that often bleed into the cecum or ascending colon. Often episodic, self-limited bleeds detected by occult positive stool tests and iron deficiency anemia. Venous bleeds, unlike arerial diverticular bleeds.
- **Inflammatory**: colitis (ischemic or infectious) may initially present with hematochezia. Stool samples will ID infectious causes (salmonella, campylobacter, and shigella). Ischemic colitis is often associated with pain and is most often left sided. Ischemia of the colon is more self limited than ischemia of the small intestine. 
    - IBD bleeds are more common with UC than Crohn, and must be differentiated from ischemic bleeds.
- **Neoplastic**: colon cancer is responsible for about 10% of rectal bleeds over the age of 50.
    - Bright blood = left-sided
    - Maroon blood/melena = right-sided
- **Other**
    - Hemorrhoids: dilated submucosal veins in the anus that are located above (internal) or below (external) the dentate line. They are usually asymptomatic but can present with hematochezia, thrombosis, strangulation, or pruritus. Hematochezia results from rupture of internal hemorrhoids, which are supplied by the superior and middle hemorrhoidal arteries. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is almost always painless. Bright red blood typically coats the stool at the end of defecation. Blood may also drip into the toilet or stain toilet paper. Occasionally, bleeding can be copious and distressing for the patient. However, significant lower GI bleeding from hemorrhoids is uncommon.
    - Solitary rectal ulcers
    - Anal fissures
    - Rectal varicies
    - Dieulafoy's lesions
    - Iatrogenic (from radiation of abdominal/pelvic cancers, biopsy, polypectomy)

### Management

- Fluid and transfusion ressesutation and management of blood thinners may be needed.
- Colonoscopy should be preformed in stable patients to preciscley identify the etiology and location of bleeding. 
- CT angiography can be used to identify activle bleeds.

## Pharmacology

- **Terlipressin**: synthetic analog of vasopressin that is released in a slow and sustained manner, permitting its administration via intermittent injections (though continuous infusion has been associated with better outcomes). Compared with octreotide, terlipressin may have more sustained hemodynamic effects in patients with bleeding varices. A study comparing the acute hemodynamic effects of terlipressin to octreotide in stable patients with cirrhosis found a sustained effect of terlipressin on portal pressure and blood flow compared with only a transient effect from octreotide [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15743362/).
- **Octreotide**: Somatostatin inhibits the release of vasodilator hormones such as glucagon, indirectly causing splanchnic vasoconstriction and decreased portal inflow. Octreotide is a long-acting analog of somatostatin given as a 50 mcg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 50 mcg per hour and is also continued for two to five days.
