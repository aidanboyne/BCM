### Glomerulonephritis

The term "glomerulonephritis" encompasses a subset of renal diseases characterized by immune-mediated damage to the basement membrane, mesangium, or capillary endothelium, leading to hematuria, proteinuria, and azotemia. Acute forms of glomerulonephritis (GN) can result from either a primary renal cause or a secondary illness that causes renal manifestations. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560644/). We can classify the disorders by their primary pathophysiological cause and modifying characteristics as shown below:

## Pathogenesis [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children)

**Immunologic damage** — Humoral (also referred to T helper cell 2-regulated) immune response to a variety of inciting agents results in immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition and complement activation within the glomeruli (figure 1). In glomerular diseases that are primarily due to immunologic injury, immune complex deposition is an active process caused by in situ binding of antibodies to antigens localized within the glomeruli. The antigens may be structural glomeruli components, such as the Goodpasture antigen located in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the non-collagenous domain of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen.

Alternatively, the antigens may be trapped or deposited within the glomerulus, including self-antigens such as chromatin components in lupus nephritis, neutrophil antigens in antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) GN, IgA in IgA nephropathy, or exogenous antigens due to infectious agents such as bacteria (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus), viruses (hepatitis B), or tumor antigens. These in situ-formed immune complexes may enlarge if there is further immune response consisting of polyclonal B-cell activation, which induces the formation of different antibodies. These include rheumatic factors IgM, anti-IgG, or anti-idiotypic antibodies that bind to these complexes. Autoantibodies to complement factors can induce C3 GN through complement activation.

Another possible mechanism for immune complex deposition is the passive process of trapping circulating immune complexes within the glomeruli. Although this process has been studied in animal models (serum sickness disease), it appears to be less commonly seen in human GN than in situ glomerular immune complex formation.

GN that is due to antibody formation requires the presence of T lymphocytes. CD4+T lymphocytes specific for nephritogenic autoantigens (proteinase-3, myeloperoxidase, Goodpasture antigen) are present in the circulation of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or anti-GBM (Goodpasture) disease. T lymphocytes may also cause GN in the absence of antibodies, as demonstrated in experimental animal models. Although the mechanism for this cellular-mediated immunity is less well defined in humans, it appears to involve activation of both T cell lymphocytes and macrophages, particularly in rapidly progressive (crescentic) GN (RPGN).

**Secondary processes** — The primary immunologic pathologic process activates the following systems that contribute to the inflammatory response and glomerular damage.
- Complement system – The humoral immunologic response activates the classic complement pathway. In some kidney disorders (eg, membranoproliferative type II and poststreptococcal GN), the alternative pathway is activated. Complement activation results in generation of chemotactic and chemokinetic peptides (C3a, C5a, and C3b) that attract white cells to the site of injury and formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9), which may cause direct injury to glomerular cells and results in the release of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), prostaglandins, and cell apoptosis. (See "Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system", section on 'Introduction'.)
- Coagulation system – In patients with RPGN, direct injury to the endothelial cells activates the coagulation cascade. This results in thrombi formation and fibrin deposition that are important components in the formation of crescents.
- Leukocyte recruitment – A constant feature of GN is the glomerular infiltration of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages), which are sequentially recruited to the glomeruli by the coordinated release of chemoattractants (eg, C3a, C5a, and CXC chemokines). When activated, these cells generate ROS (such as hydrogen peroxide), lysosomal enzymes (which damage endothelial cells, the GBM, and the mesangium), and growth factors (which induce fibrin deposition, cell proliferation, and crescent formation). As in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, who have kidney involvement, pathogenesis is due to adherence to renal endothelial cells and release proteases, ROS, and inflammatory cytokines, resulting in glomerular injury.
- Glomerular cells – Injury to the glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells result in cell proliferation and adhesion molecule expression and the production and release of vasoactive molecules (endothelin and nitric oxide), cytokines, ROS, growth factors, and prostaglandins.
- Growth factors and cytokines – Many growth factors and cytokines (eg, interleukins) are produced by glomerular cells and by inflammatory cells. These small peptides bind to specific cell surface receptors and may either promote or prevent kidney injury.
    - Growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor have important roles in glomerular injury involving glomerular cell proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and sclerosis.
    - Interleukins (IL) are known to play an important role in the inflammatory response. IL-1, IL-8, and IL-18 have a proinflammatory action in GN. IL-1 induces mesangial cell proliferation and promotes the synthesis of several substances. IL-8 is produced by mesangial cells and is a chemoattractant for granulocytes.

#### Treatments

Most etiologies of glomerulonephritis are treated via supportive care and by addressing teh underlying cause if applicable. Corticosteroids are very effective at treating minimal change disease, and immunosuppressant medications such as cyclophosphamide may be used in cases where the disease is caused by SLE. Certain immunotherapies such as  rituximab (B-cell inhibitor) for SLE and ANCA associated GN. [[ref]](https://journals.lww.com/jasn/fulltext/2010/01000/role_of_rituximab_therapy_in_glomerulonephritis.8.aspx)

#### Progression to CKD

Nearly all forms of acute glomerulonephritis have a tendency to progress to chronic glomerulonephritis. The condition is characterized by irreversible and progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, ultimately leading to a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and retention of uremic toxins. If disease progression is not halted with therapy, the net results are chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and cardiovascular disease. Chronic glomerulonephritis is the third leading cause of CKD, and accounting for about 10% of all patients on dialysis. [[ref]](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/239392-overview). 

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) defines CKD on the basis of either of the following:

* Evidence of kidney damage based on abnormal urinalysis results (eg, proteinuria or hematuria) or structural abnormalities observed on ultrasound images
* A GFR of less than 60 mL/min for 3 or more months

In accordance with this definition, the NKF developed guidelines that classify the progression of renal disease into five stages, from kidney disease with a preserved GFR to end-stage kidney failure. This classification includes treatment strategies for each progressive level, as follows:

* Stage 1 – This stage is characterized by kidney damage with a normal GFR (≥ 90 mL/min); the action plan consists of diagnosis and treatment, treatment of comorbid conditions, slowing of the progressing of kidney disease, and reduction of cardiovascular disease risks
* Stage 2 – This stage is characterized by kidney damage with a mild decrease in the GFR (60-90 mL/min); the action plan is estimation of the progression of kidney disease
* Stage 3 – This stage is characterized by a moderately decreased GFR (to 30-59 mL/min); the action plan consists of evaluation and treatment of complications
* Stage 4 – This stage is characterized by a severe decrease in the GFR (to 15-29 mL/min); the action plan is preparation for renal replacement therapy
* Stage 5 – This stage is characterized by kidney failure; the action plan is kidney replacement if the patient is uremic

Children with PSGN rarley progress to CKD. Adults are at a much higher risk. 

## Hematuria [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children)

**Gross hematuria** is defined by the presence of an increased number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine that is visible to the naked eye due to red or brown urine color. **Microscopic hematuria** is only visible upon urinalysis and can be detected via urinary dipstick. 

Glomerular bleeding is likley if red cell casts, dismorphyic RBCs, or concomitant proteinuria is discovered. The most common pediatric glomerulopathies include IgA nephropathy, Alport syndrome (which may also cause thin basement membrane disease in mild cases), and PSGN.

Hematuria can also be caused by hypercalciuria, nephrolithialisis, nutcracker syndrome (compression of L renal vein), **UTI**, **trauma**, fever, **sickle0cell disease**, or intense exercise. Though  rare in children, malignancy can also cause hematuria (i.e. Wilms tumor or transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder). Malignancy should always be ruled out in the adult population, especially in older men. Finally, schistosomiasis is a differential in endemic areas.

### Workup

Urinary dipstic and centrifugation should be preformed to confirm blood (rather than drugs, foods, free hemoglobin/myoglobin, or metabolites) is the cause of urine discoloration. 

The timing of hematuria during micturition may suggest an etiology. As an example, initial hematuria (onset of urination) usually suggests urethral bleeding; continuous bleeding throughout urination may occur from bleeding in the bladder, ureter or kidneys; and terminal bleeding (at the end of urination) is indicative of bladder disease. The color of urine may distinguish glomerular bleeding from extraglomerular bleeding. Glomerulonephritis is associated with brown urine. Bleeding from the lower urinary tract is suggested by pink or red urine and may be accompanied by blood clots.

Skin rashes or purpura suggest SLE or IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) respectivley.

### Urine Dipstick Analysis

Urine dipstick analysis is a valuable tool for medical doctors to quickly assess various urinary characteristics using colorimetric pads on a test strip. This rapid semiquantitative assessment aids in the diagnosis and monitoring of a range of medical conditions. Understanding the parameters measured and their significance is crucial in clinical practice:

#### Specific Gravity
- **Definition**: Specific gravity measures the osmolality of urine, indicating its concentration compared to distilled water.
- **Clinical Importance**: It helps assess renal concentrating ability and hydration status.
- **Relationship with Osmolality**: Specific gravity rises by approximately 0.001 for every 35 to 40 mosmol/kg increase in urine osmolality.
- **Considerations**: Specific gravity is influenced by both the number and size of particles, important when large molecules like glucose are present.

#### pH
- **Definition**: Urine pH reflects the degree of acidification of urine, ranging from 4.5 to 8 under different acid-base conditions.
- **Clinical Use**: It is especially relevant in patients with metabolic acidosis, where urine pH can fall below 5.
- **Exceptions**: Certain conditions, like infections by urease-producing pathogens, can elevate urine pH beyond 8.

#### Heme
- **Detection Method**: Heme is detected through a pseudoperoxidase reaction when exposed to peroxide and a chromogen on the test pad.
- **Interpretation**: A positive dipstick for heme does not conclusively indicate the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) and requires confirmation with microscopy.
- **False Negatives**: Rare but can occur due to interference by urinary ascorbic acid.

#### Leukocyte Esterase
- **Marker for WBCs**: Leukocyte esterase is released by lysed neutrophils and macrophages, indicating the presence of white blood cells.
- **Considerations**: Concentrated urine, proteinuria, and glucosuria may lead to false-negative results.

#### Nitrite
- **Significance**: Nitrite-positive urine suggests underlying bacteriuria, often seen in urinary tract infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae species.
- **Exceptions**: Urinary infections with low nitrate reductase-expressing organisms like enterococcal species may test negative.

#### Protein
- **Sensitivity**: The urine dipstick is most sensitive to albumin and provides a semiquantitative assessment of albuminuria.
- **Limitations**: Moderately increased albuminuria (formerly "microalbuminuria") may be below the dipstick's detection limit. Severely increased albuminuria (formerly "macroalbuminuria") can be underestimated in very dilute urine.
- **Other Considerations**: Recent exposure to iodinated radiocontrast agents can induce transient albuminuria.
- **Non-albumin Proteinuria**: The dipstick is not sensitive to non-albumin proteins, such as immunoglobulin light chains. The sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) test can be used to detect these proteins.

#### Glucose
- **Detection**: Glucose in urine triggers the production of peroxide and oxidation of a chromogen.
- **False Negatives**: Ascorbic acid can lead to false-negative results for glycosuria.
- **Clinical Implications**: Glycosuria with normal plasma glucose can indicate a defect in proximal tubule reabsorption and may be associated with the Fanconi syndrome.


## PSGN

Gnerally occurs after a recent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection. Typically labs show low C3 and total complement. Resolution generally resolves within 1-2 weeks of initial presentation. RBC casts can be seen due to cellular leakage into the tubule and subsequent trapping in Tamm-Horsfall protein matricies [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638603008291)

![Electron Microscopy](/img/PSGN_EM.jpg)

### Acute management
- Antibiotics if streptococcal infection is still present
- Supportive care includes
    - Loop diruetics to reduce blood pressure and edema (typically 1mg/kg in children up to 40mg)
    - Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy should be treated emergently with nifedipine or nicardipine
    - Dialysis can be administered if AKI is severe

Regardless of initial presentation, most patients have excellent outcomes. Adults, however, may develop hypertension, recurrent proteinuria, and chronic renal insufficiency up to 10-40 years following illness. [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis)

**Indications for referral** -  center with expertise in treating children with significant renal disease (eg, provide dialysis and perform renal biopsy):
- Fluid overload that is unresponsive or slow to respond to supportive measures (fluid restriction and diuretic therapy)
- Refractory hypertension
- Evidence of serious renal function compromise (elevated and rising serum creatinine)

**Dialysis** - For patients with serious renal impairment, indications for dialysis include:
- Life-threatening fluid overload (pulmonary edema, heart failure, and hypertension) that is refractory to medical therapy.
- Hyperkalemia (serum or plasma potassium >6.5 mEq/L) unresponsive to medical therapy (see "Management of hyperkalemia in children", section on 'Therapies removing potassium from the body').
- Uremia defined as a BUN between 89 to 100 mg/dL.

**Renal Biopsy** -  In the acute setting, because it is unusual for patients with PSGN to require dialysis, a renal biopsy is performed in patients with significant renal impairment who require or are progressing towards dialysis treatment to confirm the diagnosis of PSGN. A renal biopsy is also indicated in cases of normal levels of C3 at presentation or when C3 remains low after one month.

### Complement Activation

Acute PSGN causes elevated **plasma nephritis associated plasmin receptor (NAPlr)** and **streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPEB)**. NAPlr has been shown to activtate C3 and promote release of inflammatory cytokines, while SPEB degrades complement factors. Beta hemolytic Strep is also associated with the production of antifactor B autoantibodies that stabilize C3 convertase and are pivotal to the activation of the alternative complement pathway. [[ref]](https://journals.lww.com/jasn/Fulltext/2021/03000/Autoimmunity_in_Acute_Poststreptococcal_GN__A.6.aspx)

![Strep Complement](/img/Strep_GN.jpeg)

_Strep. interaction with the complement system_

![Complement](/img/complement_pathways.png)

_Complement activation pathways_

#### Streptolysin O

Anti-streptolysin O (ASO or ASLO) is the antibody made against streptolysin O, an immunogenic, oxygen-labile streptococcal hemolytic exotoxin produced by most strains of group A and many strains of groups C and G Streptococcus bacteria. The "O" in the name stands for oxygen-labile; the other related toxin being oxygen-stable streptolysin-S. The main function of streptolysin O is to cause hemolysis (the breaking open of red blood cells)—in particular, beta-hemolysis.

Levels over 200 units in adults or 100 units in children are considered significant. They begin to rise 1-3 weeks following infection and may remain elevated for up to 6 months.

### HTN in Nephritic Syndrome

Patients with chronic GN become salt sensitive as renal damage including arteriolosclerosis progresses and the consequent renal ischemia causes the stimulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system(RAAS). Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system also contributes to hypertension in chronic GN.  The use of agents that block the RAAS system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥30mg/ 24 h. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737660/).

### Urea and Creatinine

Urea is synthesized in the liver from ammonia to allow nitrogen excretion in the urine. BUN is typically in the range of 5-20 mg/dL and can serve as an indicator of kidney function. However, it can vary independently of kidey function due to protein intake, liver disease, GI bleed, CHF, corticoid therapy, or hydration. 

Creatinine is a byproduct of phosphocreatinine breakdown in the muscles. It is freely filtered and secreted but not reabsorbed by the kidneys and can be used as an estimate of GFR (though it will be slightly high due to secretion in PCT). Clearance can lead to falsley high GFR measurements due to large protein intake, recent intense exercise, high muscle mass, or due to certain drugs. Flase low estimates are possible in vegans, those with low muscle mass, severe liver disease, anemia, hyperthyroidism, or pregnancy. The normal range of creatinine clearance is 110 to 150mL/min in males and 100 to 130mL/min in females.

#### Furosemide

Furosemide inhibits tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules and the thick ascending loop of Henle by inhibiting the sodium-chloride cotransport system resulting in excessive excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium
- First line in acute decompensated heart failure, liver failure (alongside spirolactone), and renal failure (including nephrotic syndromes)
- Second line in HTN

_Note:_ in patients with GFR ≤30 mL/min, increased doses are required to achieve desired diuretic response. If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during severe progressive renal disease treatment, furosemide should be discontinued.
