# Diagnosis

Our patient presents with coughing, dyspnea at rest, syncope, and diffuse end-expiratory wheezing. Pertinent negatives include rhonchi, edema, abnormal heart sounds, or pursed lip breathing. This gives us a differential of the following:
- Acute asthma attack
- Pulmonary embolism
- Foreign body aspiration
- NO poisoning

### Pertinent Negatives
* Stridor:
    - Inspiratory Stridor: obstruction in the extrathoracic region causes inspiratory stridor. During inspiration, the intratracheal pressure falls below the atmospheric pressure, causing a collapse of the airway.
    - Expiratory Stridor: obstruction in the intrathoracic region causes expiratory stridor. During expiration, the increased pleural pressure compresses the airway causing a decrease in the airway size at the site of the intrathoracic obstruction.
    - Both inspiratory and expiratory stridor occurs because of bacterial tracheitis and foreign bodies. Laryngeal webs and vocal cord paralysis occur due to a fixed airway obstruction, which does not change with respiration.
* Rhonchi: continuous, low-pitched sounds that best heard on expiration. The sound might move around to different parts of your chest when you cough, moving mucus around. The sound is sometimes described as snoring or gurgling. Usually indicate airway secretions.
* Lower extremity edema: 
    - Pitting: associated with water overload. Occurs due to venous pooling from CHF and other conditions such as DVT, cirrhosis, venous insufficiency, and kidney disease.
        - Graded from +1 (≤2mm immediate rebound), +2 (3-4mm rebound ≤15s), +3 (5-6mm rebound ≤1min) to +4 (8+mm rebounding within 2-3 min)
    - Non-pitting: associated with mixed fluid buildup (i.e. proteins, salts...) due to lymphedema (secondary to lymphectomy or infection), myxedema from hypothyroidism, andioedema from allergens, or lipedemia.
* Pursed lip breathing: technique that allows people to control their oxygenation and ventilation by inspiring through the nose and exhaling through the mouth at a slow controlled flow, creating a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure.
* Abnormal heart sounds: listen for potential murmurs, S3 (indicating volume overload or advanced AV valve regurgitation), and S4 (indicating filling of stiff ventricles --> hypertrophy or high LVEDP).

_Summary of Lung Sounds_

### Pulmonary Exam

#### Physical
1. Inspect external chest
2. Inspect chest movement/excursion via hands on back
3. Percuss the chest on 3 levels each side of back
4. Auscultate lungs 2x2 anteriorly and 3x2 dorsally while asking patient to breath in and out
5. Tactile fremitus on 3 levels of posterior chest wall while asking patient to say 1-2-3 and assessing symmetry of vibration
6. Egophany: ask patient to say E while auscultating areas of abnormal breath sound or dullness. Listen for "eeee" to "aaahy" transition


#### ROS

Ask for the following:
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

![Dyspnea Scheme](/img/dyspnea_scheme.jpg)

* Exertional fatigue / limitation
* Wheezing
* Cough 
* Sputum production
* Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* Chest pain (especially with breathing)


# Pathophysiology

### Syncope

#### Cardiogenic
- Arrhythmogenic syncope: bradycardia and/or reduced EF reduce brain perfusion. Causes include sick sinus, Vtach, AV block, SVPT, Torsades de Pointes...
- Cardiovascular: myocardial dysfunction or outflow obstruction reduce brain perfusion. Causes include massive MI, aortic stenosis, MV prolapse, ACD, PE, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and tamponade.
#### Non-cardiogenic - Reflex
* Vasovagal (neurocardiogenic): vasovagal response causes acute loss hypotension and loss of cerebral blood flow. Can be caused by prolonged standing, emotional stress, pain, heat, or can be idiopathic.
* Situational: vasovagal response causes acute loss hypotension and loss of cerebral blood flow. Triggers include cough, swallowing, laughing, defication, and micturition
* Carotid Sinus Syndrome: activation of carotid feedback causes acute hypotension i.e. when shaving, massage, putting on a tie.

#### Non-cardiogenic - Other
* Orthostatic: hypotension puon standing. Can be due to dehydration, vasodilators or HR limiting meds, prolonged bed rest, anemia, age related baroreceptor dysfunction, or diabetic neuropathy/Parkinson's.
* POTS: orthostasis with tachycardia and no hypertention. Poorly understood and often follows pregnancy, trauma, surgery, or viral illness.
* Cough syncope is a well-known entity which results in loss of consciousness during episodes of cough. It commonly occurs in patients with severe chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and asthma. Really interesting case [here](https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/17/4/210094#nogo) where man crashes due to cough syncope and has licesnce revoked as per EU legislation, leading to him loosing his job and losing access to care which only make the underlying COPD worse.

## Obstructive Lung Diseases

Broadly, obstructive lung diseases are characterized by obstruciton of airflow that traps air inside the lungs. On PFTs, we see an increase in residual volume (RV), functional residual vapacity (FRC) along with a **decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio** (both are down, but FEV1 much lower due to narrowed airways). 

TLC is either normal or increased due to air trapping and hyperinflation. VQ mismatch is possible as bloodflow is normal but flow is reduced. This leads to hypoxic vasoconstriction and resulting pulmonary hypertension. Flow volume loops are shifted to the left.

### COPD

Chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema obstruct airflow. Bronchodilators will not help much (<12% improvement). Too much O2 can be harmful as it can suprpess respiratory stinulus. 

#### Etiology and Epidemiology

COPD is primarily present in smokers and those greater than age 40. Prevalence increases with age and it is currently the third most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2015, the prevalence of COPD was 174 million and there were approximately 3.2 million deaths due to COPD worldwide. However, the prevalence is likely to be underestimated due to the underdiagnosis of COPD. 

COPD is caused by prolonged exposure to harmful particles or gases. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD worldwide. Other causes may include second-hand smoke, environmental and occupational exposures, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559281/)

#### Chronic Bronchitis
- Triggered by smoking or occupational/environmental pollutants
    - Inflammation of tracheobronchial tree and increased mucus production
    - Productive cough and wheezing caused by this blockage
    - Crackles, rales, and hypoxemia are possible.
- Cyanosis is possible (blue bloaters) if no gas exchange occurs at all.
- Productive cough for at least 3 months over period of 2+ years, often have polycythemia

#### Emphysema
- Permanant enlargement and loss of elasticity of alveolar wall due to injury. Neutrophils break down walls and trap air distal to point of collapse.
    - Centralacinar is most common, and seen with smoking
    - Panacinar affects entire acinus and is associated with α1-antitripsyn deficiency
    - Paraseptal typically affects alveoli along lobular borders
- SOB is prominent and individuals exhale with pursed lips to increase pressure in alveoli and prevent collapse (pink puffers with barrel chest)
- Enlargement of airspace on CT/CXR with flattened diaphragm. Also low DLCO is possible.

#### Diagnosis
General:
* Significant respiratory distress in acute exacerbations
* Muscle wasting

Lungs:
* Accessory respiratory muscle use
* Prolonged expiration
* Wheezing
* Pursed-lip breathing

Chest:
* Increased anterior-posterior chest wall diameter (barrel chest)

Skin:
* Central cyanosis when arterial oxygenation is low

Extremities:
* Digital clubbing
* Lower extremity edema in right heart failure

#### Treatments
The classes of commonly used medications in COPD include bronchodilators (beta2-agonists, antimuscarinics, methylxanthines), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), systemic glucocorticoids, phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors, and antibiotics.
- β2 agonists relax airway smooth muscle. Can use short and long acting
- Antimuscarinics block M3 receptors in airway. Can use short and long acting
- Methylxanthines cause bronchodilation, likley due to phosphodiesterase (PDE) III/IV inhibition. Side effects include intractible vomiting and arrhythmias.
- Corticosteriods decrease inflammation but can predispose patients to pneumonias.
- PDE-IV inhibitors reduce inflammation by inhibiting cAMP breakdown.

Flu vaccines are reccomended for all COPD patients, and Penumococcal vaccines for patients 65 and older.

#### Complications

Include acute exacerbations with extreme SOB, lowered QOL, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, weight loss, and infection susceptibility.

### Asthma
Inflammation and hyperresonsiveness of bronchial smooth muscle characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction via **type I hypersensitivity reaction**. Th2 cells are activated, releasing IL4 and increasing B-cell IgE production and IL5 recruiting eiosinophils which increase inflammation. Mast cells release histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins causing bronchoconstriction and edema contributing to symptoms.

Over time, the symptoms can be irreversible due to scarring and SM hyperplasia. PFT will only show obstructive pulmonary signs when having symptoms. Methacholine challenge can reveal PFT changes (> 20% decrease in FEV1). DLCO is normal or slightly increased, and sputum analysis can show curschmann spirals and Charcot-Lyden crystals. Severe asthma can show pulsus paradoxus due to very negative intrapleural pressure during inspiration. See previous PBL case [here](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/posts/PBL_TTMW1_C1_Asthma/)

### Bronchiectasis
Damaged and dilated bronchi and bronchioles secondary to chronic inflammation and mucus obstruction. Can be caused by
- Primary ciliary dyskinesia (if associated with )
- Cystic fibrosis (extra sticky mucus)
- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

Cytokines released damage the epithelial cells and destroy elastin, causing hypoxic vasoconstriction as certain areas loose ventillation. Productive cough of foul sputum along with history of recurrent pneumonia are common findings.

### Cough

![Cough Physiology](/img/cough_physiology.PNG)

_Various receptors scattered throughout the airway and activated via mechanical and chemical stimuli transmit signals via vagus nerve to jugular and nodose ganglions which then pass the signal to the CNS at the nucleus tractus solitaris (NTS). The NTS then passes the signal to appropriate effectors to cause cough._ [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054205001107?via%3Dihub)

![Chronic Cough](/img/Chronic_cough.jpg)


#### Sputum Colors
* Clear: healthy
* White: allergies, asthmas, or viral infection
* Yellow/Green: bacterial infection
* Bloody: TB, cancer, CHF
* Charcoal: environmental conditions or smoker
* Brown: CF, bronchiectasis
* Black: Fungal infection

### Spirometry

**Asthma**: Asthma is denoted by forced expiratory volume at 1 second intervals (FEV1) / forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 70% and FEV1 of less than 80% predicted which demonstrates reversibility with bronchodilation (FEV1 increases post-bronchodilator ≥ 12% and > 200 mL).
If spirometry is normal and history is suggestive of asthma, consider bronchoprovocation challenge (methacholine, mannitol, exercise; this should be done by a specialist in pulmonary medicine).

**COPD**: Increase in residual volume (RV), functional residual vapacity (FRC) along with a **decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio** (both are down, but FEV1 much lower due to narrowed airways). Curves are often shifted to the left.

# Treatment

* **Albuterol**: Short acting β2 agonist. Also inhibits release of immediate hypersensitivity mediators from immune cells such as mast cells. Can be inhaled via powders or nebulizers, or ingested.

* **Ipratropium**: acetylcholine antagonist via blockade of muscarinic cholinergic (M3) receptors. Blocking cholinergic receptors decreases the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This decrease in the lung airways will lead to decreased contraction of the smooth muscles. Oral or intranasal inhalation.

* **Steroids**

![Steroid MOA](/img/corticosteroid_MOA.gif)

Recent studies have shown there is no significant difference in outcomes between inhaled and oral corticosteroids. However, inhaled steriods can avoid some of the adverse reactions of systemic steroids. [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2003/0301/p1107.html)



#### Specialist Access

Though Medicare does cover specialist care, there are often predetermined criteria patients must meet before reciving care. They may also have a more limited network than patients with private insurance, compounding transportation and access issues faced by many patients on Medicare.
