## Asthma

### Overview

Asthma is a chronic disease that can present as shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing due to inflamed and narrowed airways. It is associated with other allergic diseases like eczema and hayfever. Though very common in children, pediatric asthma does not usually carry on to adulthood.

Asthma is influenced by both genetics and the environment. It is most commonly triggered by a URI (esp. Human Rhinovirus), but can also be triggered by **exercise**, acid reflux, chronic sinusitis, cold air, allergens, tobacco smoke, chemical fumes, obesity, aspirin/beta-blockers, and emotional factors.

Exercise induced asthma is a result of more rapid breathing and heart rate. This both increases cell exposure to potential irritants and cools and dries the airway, pulling fluid into the airway which can result in an acute episode.

Unlike COPD, asthma attacks are acute and (theoretically) fully reversible. During an attack, the airway is infiltrated with inflammatory cells, SM contracts, and mucus is hypersecreted with plug formation. Rapid treatment allows medication to reach the mucosa and prevents excessive edematous inflammation. 

There are 4 severity stages: **Intermittent** asthma occurs when one has symptoms less than two days a week, and nighttime awakenings less than two times a month. **Mild** asthma consists of having episodes more than two days a week (but not daily), while there are nighttime awakenings of 3 to 4 times a month. **Moderate** asthma is where the patient is symptomatic daily and has nighttime awakenings greater than once a week but not nightly. **Severe** asthma is where a patient is symptomatic throughout the day and often has nighttime awakenings more than seven times within a week.

### Asthma History/Phisical

Asthma typically presesnts with a history of wheezing/coughing made worse with allergies, exercise, and cold - often worse at night. It often presents alongsite other allergic diseases (atopy). Wheezing, the product of fluttering vibrations of narrowed airway walls, induced by a diminished airflow velocity, is the primary indicator of asthma in both children and adults. The pitch and, more so, duration of wheeze are the only two characteristics that correlate well with the severity of airway obstruction


_During acute attack_: Mild tachycardia, sitting forward to splint open airway. Expiratory wheeze. Hypoxia and silent chest in life-threatening asthma. Children may appear drowsy, cold, confused, and have low HR indicating respiratory fatigue. Life-threatening asthma does not respond to steroids and B-2 agonists and is known as _status asthmaticus_.

Patients not experiencing acute episode should have normal vitals:
 - Blood pressure: between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg
 - Breathing: 12 to 18 breaths per minute
 - Pulse: 60 to 100 beats per minute
 - Temperature: 97.8°F to 99.1°F (36.5°C to 37.3°C)
 
 In this specific case, provider noted no fevers, chest pain, and/or leg swelling which may point to infection or potential cardiac origin of symptoms. Unilateral swelling --> DVT or PE. Bilateral swelling can be heart or renal failure.

### Labs

Chest x-ray followed by spirometry with bronchodilator tests is common diagnositic. Obstruction in spirometry is defined as FEV1 less than 0.8, and FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70. If the wheezing resolves with a bronchodilation agent, asthma is much more likley than a tumor or mass. Falling pO2 on pulse oximetry (normal range 75–100 mm Hg, or 95–100%) is a late finding, indicating a severely unwell or peri-arrest patient.

### Treatment and Pharmacology

Asthma is typically treated using inhaled medications. Inhalers are an unpowered device which delivers medication directly to the lungs. There are several primary types of drugs delivered by inhalers, including short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators, and inhaled corticosteroids.

 - **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: most effective long-term controllers of asthma. They suppress inflammation mainly by switching off multiple activated inflammatory genes through reversing histone acetylation via the recruitment of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). This decreases levels of inflammatory immune cells (Eosinophil, T-lymphocyte, Mast-cell, Macrophage, Dentritic cell) and inflammatory cytokines.  ICS bind to glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm, specifically GRα and then translocate to the nucleus.
	- ICS have the end effects of lowered airway swelling, fluid permeability, and mucous production.
	- Smokers and patients with COPD or severe asthma are usually partially or fully resistant to corticosteroids.
	 - Corticosteroids protect against the down-regulation of β2-receptors, increasing efficacy of β2-agonists.
	- Examples include Budesonide and Fluticasone <br><br>
 - **β2-agonists (β-blockers)**: bronchodialators which target smooth muscles in the bronchioles of the lung. Only treat symptoms and not underlying pathology. When the beta-2 receptor (G-protein coupled receptor) is activated, the smooth muscle of the airway relaxes. Subsequently, the patient experiences better airflow for a period. Consistent use of beta-2 agonists for an extended amount of time reduces their efficacy due to the down-regulation of the beta-2 receptor in the airways. Short-acting bronchodilators have a half-life of 3 to 6 hours, while longer-acting bronchodilators have a half-life of 18 to 24 hours
	 - The most frequent and common adverse effects include trembling, nervousness, sudden, noticeable heart palpitations, and muscle cramps. More severe effects include sudden constriction of the bronchial airways, paradoxical bronchospasm, hypokalemia, and in rare cases, myocardial infarction
	 - Short-term (rescue) for accute attacks (albuterol).
	 - Long-term (management) for daily use.

Muscarinic antagonists offer an alternative to β2-agonists for acute episode treatment. Leukotrine antoagonists can also be prescribed but have been shown to be inferior to ICS. Tiotropium (Atrovent) (anticholinergic) can be added to regimine if ICS + 1 other regulator are insufficient and works by inhibiting parasympathetic nervous system receptors. Allergy meds such as antihistamines (i.e. Claritin) help, especially in pediatric patients.

## Social Determinants 

### Social and Environmental Contributors to Asthma
Allergens include pollen, mold, animal dander, insect (esp. cockroach) parts. Irritants include smoke, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), dust, gas or diesel fumes, and chlorine. Particularly important to this case are gas and diesel fumes (patient is driver) and his childhood exposure to ETS and cockraoch/mouse allergens.

Black and Latinx Americans have a higher asthma prevalence and greater asthma morbidity than White
Americans and also bear a disproportionate burden of SDoH. Inequities in SDoH are rooted in structural racism and
population-level injustices that affect the socioeconomic status, physical environment, and health care access/quality of Black and Latinx Americans. The link of low income to prevalent asthma and asthma morbidity
is likely multifactorial, as low income influences other SDoH, such as
education, housing, exposure to pests and pollution, and access to
food and health care, all of which are risk factors for asthma and
asthma morbidity.<sup>4</sup>

### Insurance 
 - (Texas) County indigent health care program: for those inelegible for medicaid
 - Clinical trials
 - Free clinics, especially near academic centers
 - Social workers essential for cost issues - physiciancs don't always know (and aren't expected to know) costs of procedures and medications.
	- No suprises act: requires good faith estimates from provider to patient prior to consent to treatment if requested. Exceptions for urgent situations. Also requires medical bills to be sent out in reasonable time following treatment.

## Case Terms and definitions

 - **Rhales**: Fine, high-pitched crackling/rattling on inhalation. Can indicate aveolar damage or aveolar fluid buildup
 - **Rhonchi**: low-pitched sound similar to snoring in early inhalation/expiration. Indicates something (fluid/mucous) in airway.
 - **End-expiratory wheezes**: high-pitched long squeak at the end of exhalation indicating reduced PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate).
 - **Conjunctiva**: Mucous membrane covering front of eye and inside of eyelids. Normally clear (appears white) with fine blood vessels. Red or yellow discoloration is abnormal.
 - **Murmurs**: Systolic murmurs may result from AV valve regurg or aortic/pulmonary valve stenosis. Diastolic murmurs may result from aortic/pulmonary valve regurg or AV valve stenosis and are always pathologic. [Video with sounds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwr2GZCmQM)
 - **(Pleural) Rub**: Sound similar to the sound made by walking on fresh snow caused by the movement of inflamed and roughened pleural surfaces against one another. Often accompanied by pain worsened on inspiraition. Distinguised from pericardial rub which occurs with or without breathing. Usually inidicative of pleural or pericardial inflammation.
 - **Gallops**: 3rd (early diastole) and 4th (late diastole) heart sounds thought to be caused by ventricular overload. 4th is always abnormal, and 3rd is abnormal normal over the age of 40. Can indicate congestive hearth failure or arrythmias. [Video with sounds.](https://youtu.be/o8eqYHCy7dw?t=47)
 - **Jugular venous distension**: Bulge in the veins running down the right side of a person’s neck resulting from increased pressure in a vein called the vena cava. Often a sign of heart failure.
