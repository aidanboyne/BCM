# Diagnosis

* Phyiscal Exam
    * Rales: abnormal rattling, clicking, or bubbling sound on **inhalation**. Popping open of fluid filled alveoli and airways.
    * Hypertension: Chronic HTN increases cardiac work leading to LVH and is also a risk factor for coronary heart disease which can result in ischemic heart failure
    * Low SpO2 [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circheartfailure.114.001825): pulmonary edema reduces gas exchange. Lower peripheral O2 extraction
    * Tachycardia: Reduced SpO2 causes compensentory increase in HR
    * Tachypnea: see above
    * **Edema** [[ref]](https://www.osmosis.org/answers/pitting-edema)
        - Pitting: associated with water overload. Occurs due to venous pooling from CHF and other conditions such as DVT, cirrhosis, venous insufficiency, and kidney disease.
            - Graded from +1 (≤2mm immediate rebound), +2 (3-4mm rebound ≤15s), +3 (5-6mm rebound ≤1min) to +4 (8+mm rebounding within 2-3 min)
        - Non-pitting: associated with mixed fluid buildup (i.e. proteins, salts...) due to lymphedema (secondary to lymphectomy or infection), myxedema from hypothyroidism, andioedema from allergens, or lipedemia.
    * **S4** heart sound: diastolic heart failure with LVH impairs compliance, causing turbulence during ventricular filling.

### NYHA Functional Classification

* **Class I**: Symptom onset with more than ordinary level of activity
* **Class II**: Symptom onset with an ordinary level of activity
* **Class III**: Symptom onset with minimal activity
    * Class IIIa: No dyspnea at rest
    * Class IIIb: Recent onset of dyspnea at rest
* **Class IV**: Symptoms at rest

### Firmingham Diagnostic Criteria

Any 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria have high sensitivity and relativley low specificity for CHF diagnosis:
- **Major**
    * Acute pulmonary edema
    * Cardiomegaly
    * Hepatojugular reflex
    * Neck vein distention
    * Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea
    * Pulmonary rales
    * Third heart sound (S3 Gallop)
    * Weight loss of 4.5 kg or more in 5 days in response to treatment
    * Central venous pressure greater than 16 cm of water
    * Radiographic cardiomegaly
- **Minor**
    * Ankle edema
    * Dyspnea on exertion
    * Hepatomegaly
    * Nocturnal cough
    * Pleural effusion
    * Tachycardia (heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute)
    * A decrease in vital capacity by one third the maximal value recorded

### H2PFEF

![H2PFEF Score](/img/h2fpef.gif)

By establishing the probability of disease, the H2FPEF score may be used to effectively rule out disease among patients with low scores (eg, 0 or 1), to establish the diagnosis with reasonably high confidence at higher scores (eg, 6–9), and to identify patients for whom additional testing is needed with intermediate scores (eg, 2–5). Rather than forcing a probabilistic diagnosis (HFpEF) into binary categories (present or absent), this Bayesian approach provides a framework that can be used to determine whether there is sufficient confidence in the working diagnosis or whether further evaluation is necessary based on the identified probability of disease.

# Pathophysiology

## Normal Heart Cycle

![Cardiac Cycle](/img/cardiac_cycle.png)

In **HFrEF** we have a systolic function disorder due to lowered LV contractility. This leads to lowered ejection fraction as seen on the left of the image below. **HFpEF**, on the other hand, conserves ejection fraction (i.e. the width of the loop does not decrease), however the compliance of the ventricle is lowered, leading to chronically elevated LVEDP.

![HF loops](/img/HF_PVloops.PNG)

## Congestive Heart Failure

Heart cannot pump enough blood to meet demand. Can be right, left, or bilateral and is characterized by systolic or diastolic dysfunction.

### Etiology

Structural or functional abnormalities, largeley from CAD, MI, and DM. HTN resulting in LVH, uncrontrolled arrythmia, CHD, restrictive cardiomyopathies/pericarditis and myocarditis are other potential causes.

### Epidemiology

Age is a primary determinany. African-americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and recent immigrants are more likley than Caucasians to have CHF. Sedentary lifestyle and obesity are also associated.

### Pathophysiology

- **Frank starling mechanism:** Heart failure caused by the impaired contractile function of the left ventricle causes a downward shift of the left ventricular performance curve. At any given preload, the stroke volume will be decreased as compared to normal. This reduced stroke volume leads to incomplete left ventricular emptying. Consequently, the volume of blood that accumulates in the left ventricle during diastole is greater than normal. The amplified residual volume increases the stretch of the myocardial fibers and induces a greater stroke volume with the next contraction via the Frank-Starling mechanism. This allows for better emptying of the enlarged left ventricle and preserves cardiac output. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26779498/)
- **Myocardial hypertrophy** and hypercontractility attempt to increase CO. Eccentric remodeling is a maladaptive compenstation to high wall stress.
- Sympathetic release of epi, norepi, ET-1, and vasopression increase afterload. We also see increased cAMP and ensuing Ca2+ influx to increase contractility. However this **increases myocardial oxygen demand** and can result in cell death
- **RAAS** activation increases fluid retention and vasoconstriciton.

### Classification
* **HFrEF**: reduced ejection fraction due to increase in EDV with reduced contractility, often secondary to ischemia or dilated cardiomyopathy. _Systolic dysfunction_
* **HFpEF**: preserved ejection fraction due to normal EDV with reduced compliance and resulting increased end diastolic pressure, often secondary to myocardial hypertrophy. _Diastolic dysfunction_

## Labs
- Serum BNP is a relativley specific marker to distinguish from noncardiac dyspnea. It is an indepentent predictor of increased LVEDP, but should not be used to drive treatment plans as they can be elevated in patients with advanced heart failure, obesity, hypothyroidism, renal dysfunction, or Afib. Physiologically, BNP leads to vasodilation, inhibition of SNS stimulation of the heart, diuresis, and RAAS inhibition. BNP binding to natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPR-A) causes increase in cGMP. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860679/). Levels are highly correlated with NYHA functional status.

## Imaging

**Echocardiography** is the most commonly used test for the diagnosis of HF. It can assess for systolic and diastolic dysfunction and help elucidate the presence of focal wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology. Because cardiac structural and functional changes in HFpEF are more subtle and less specific than in heart failure with reduced LVEF, the demonstration of increased left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) is central to establishing this diagnosis. The invasive assessment of LVFP is usually done during right heart catheterization (RHC) by measurement of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). Transthoracic echocardiography can be used to noninvasively estimate LVFP. Several echocardiographic measures have been used,3 but the ratio of the peak early mitral inflow velocity (E) over the early diastolic mitral annular velocity (e′) has gained wide acceptability in routine clinical practice. However, there is debate on the accuract of this metric to estimate and track changes in LVFP [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circheartfailure.115.002161)

**CXR**: Chest radiographs are used to assess the degree of pulmonary congestion and cardiac contour (to determine the presence of cardiomegaly). Findings indicative of congestive heart failure on chest radiographs include enlarged cardiac silhouette, edema at the lung bases, and vascular congestion. Negative findings do not ncecessarily rule out CHF.

## Tests

**EKG**: May be normal in patients with HFpEF. The most common abnormality detected is LV hypertrophy, and the test is important to identify atrial firillation.

**Invasive Diastolic Stress Testing**: 
Diastolic dysfunction is a key factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Frequently, however, symptoms of diastolic dysfunction occur only during exercise, as LV filling pressure is normal at rest, but increases with exercise. Invasive tests use a catheter to measure LV filling pressure (such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure PCWP, mean left atrial pressure, mean LV diastolic pressure, and LVEDP). In the early stages of diastolic dysfunction, only LV end-diastolic pressure is the only abnormally elevated pressure, whereas mean PCWP and LA pressure remain normal. With tachycardia and/or increased LV afterload, mean PCWP and LA pressure increase, providing the basis for the diastolic stress test.

PCWP is an indirect esimate of LV diastolic pressure via right heart cathederization through right internal jugular. Noninasive exercise tests via echo are another possiblity, though are not as accurate. 

### Complications

Clinical complications of HF include decreased quality of life (lower exertion capability due to decreased oxygen sypply), decreased functional capacity, unintentional weight loss (cardiac cachexia), renal dysfunction (cardiorenal disease), and liver dysfunction (hepatic congestion). Adverse cardiac events associated with HF include valvular dysfunction with dilated cardiomyopathy, MI, and ventricular arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death is a potential complication for patients with HFrEF and requires primary prevention with ICD placement, as discussed above. Complications of the treatment for HF include renal failure, hypotension, and recurrent nosocomial infections due to frequent hospitalizations and central venous access.

## Treatment

### This case
Furosemide (Lasix) was prescribed in this patient to relieve hypervolemia and thus reduce the workflow on the heart and attenuate LV remodelling. This also relieves some of the peripheral and pulmonary edema seen in the case. Diuretics in chronic CHF should be prescribed at the lowest dose possible. Recent trials have suggested second-gen diuretics such as bumetanide and torasemide may be more effective in managing CHF than furosemide [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6159465/).

Supplemental O2 is given to immediatley restore oxygenation and relieve dyspnea. 2 IV lines are established. Not sure why 2 IVs were established rather than one, as this is more common in trauma cases and is not clear to have any benefit even in that case.

### Pharmacologic

* **Class I Recommendations**
    * Evidence-based specific beta-blockers (carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate) with one of the following:
    * Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) 
    * Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 
    * Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) 
    * Chronic symptomatic HFrEF NYHA class II or III, replace an ACEI or ARB with an ARNI
* **Class IIa**
    * Ivabradine for patients with symptomatic HF while on goal-directed medical therapy for chronic HFrEF with LVEF less than or equal to 35% and in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of at least 70 bpm at rest.
* **Class III**
    * ARNI should not be given with or within 36 hours of the last dose of an ACEI or in patients with a history of angioedema

### Lifestyle

Healthy lifestyle habits such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and alcohol cessation. These strategies can help prevent the development of HF in patients at high risk for the disease and slow the progression in those who are already diagnosed with it. Control of underlying factors (i.e. low fat and sodium diet to control athersclerosis, HTN, and diabetes in this case) is essential.

Along with increasing blood volume and thus cariac work demand, a high sodium diet is associated with increased expression of β—myosin heavy chain, decreased expression of α/β—myosin heavy chain, increased myocyte enhancer factor 2/nuclear factor of activated T cell transcriptional activity, and increased salt-inducible kinase 1 expression, which leads to alteration in myocardial mechanical performance. A high sodium diet is also associated with alterations in various proteins responsible for calcium homeostasis and myocardial contractility. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7763082/)


### Cardiac Remodeling 

Cardiac remodeling is defined as a group of molecular, cellular and interstitial changes that manifest clinically as changes in size, mass, geometry and function of the heart after injury. The process results in poor prognosis because of its association with ventricular dysfunction and malignant arrhythmias.

Initial studies attributed HFpEF to dysfunction of the myocardium during the filling phase of the cardiac cycle; diastolic stiffness, prolonged isovolumic LV relaxation, and slow LV filling were attributed to pathological dysfunction of the ventricular myocyte during diastole. However, it is clear that in some instances, the LV myocardium is an innocent bystander, manifesting dysfunctional filling caused by volume overload, insufficiency of perfusion, or inadequate filling times. In many instances, it is likely that perturbed diastolic relaxation9 and excessive volume resulting from extrinsic factors8 combine to perturb ventricular filling.

Vascular stiffening and generalized systemic vascular dysfunction are observed in patients with HFpEF. Reduced aortic distensibility and increased end-systolic elastance lead to exaggerated fluctuations in blood pressure for the same change in afterload and preload.6 Indeed, therapeutic strategies that specifically target ventricular-arterial stiffening improve exercise tolerance in elderly, hypertensive individuals. In addition, impaired flow-mediated vasodilation has been observed, implicating endothelial dysfunction in HFpEF pathophysiology and suggesting the possibility of benefit with therapies targeting nitric oxide bioavailability. Pulmonary hypertension is also associated with HFpEF, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures predict mortality in HFpEF patients.

# Treatment

* **Carvedilol**: non-selective beta-blocker with α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist properties. The α1 antagonist property potentiates peripheral vasodilating effects. Thus, carvedilol maintains cardiac output by decreasing afterload in conjunction with a cardiac beta-blockade which decreases contractility and lowers cardiomyocyte oxygen demand. It has a lesser effect on heart rate than pure selective beta-blocker, but is a treatment of choice for HFrEF and is also used as an antihypertensive.

* **Furosemide**: inhibits tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules and the thick ascending loop of Henle by inhibiting the sodium-chloride cotransport system resulting in excessive excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium. It is a potent diuretic, but it is imperative to repeat the furosemide dose at 6 to 8-hour intervals to avoid post diuretic sodium retention and achieve significant diuresis.

* **Metformin**: Metformin, classified as a biguanide drug, effectively lowers blood glucose levels by decreasing glucose production in the liver, diminishing intestinal absorption, and enhancing insulin sensitivity. As a result, metformin effectively lowers both basal and postprandial blood glucose levels.

* **Rosuvastatin**: inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, which reduces the production of mevalonic acid from HMG-CoA. Furthermore, this results in an increase of low-density lipoprotein receptors on hepatocyte membranes and stimulation of low-density lipoprotein catabolism. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also decrease levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP). They also possess pleiotropic properties, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, anticoagulant effects, reduced inflammation at the site of a coronary plaque, and improved endothelial function.

* **Lisinopril**: Lisinopril is a competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. A decrease in angiotensin II subsequently causes a reduction in aldosterone secretion, which causes a decrease in sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and decreases potassium excretion that may result in a small increase in serum potassium with lisinopril use. By removing the negative feedback of angiotensin II, lisinopril leads to increased serum renin activity.

# Social Determinants

## VA Pharmacy

Findings suggest that Veterans who use VA pharmacy services appear to be more ill than their counterparts who do not use the VA pharmacy benefit. Among younger Veterans, users of the VA pharmacy were more than twice as likely to report fair or poor general health status (53.5% vs. 21.4%) and more than three times as likely to report fair or poor mental health status (32.1% vs. 10.2%). Moreover, both non-elderly and elderly users of VA pharmacy services reported more medical conditions and were more disabled. Overall results show a higher proportion of Veterans who use VA pharmacy services are African American and have no alternative insurance. Compared to non-users, VA pharmacy users also were more likely to be unemployed or out of the labor force (47.7% vs. 19.8%), and living in a poor or low income family (32.4% vs. 11.5%) [[ref]](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/research/citations/PubBriefs/articles.cfm?RecordID=179)

### VA status

Priority group may change in some cases, such as if income level changes, or a service-connected disability gets worse and a higher disability rating is assigned. See the [VA Website](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) for more information.

### Medication Adherence and SES

Low socioeconomic status and poor adherence to antihypertensive medication are associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular disease risks, but patients with low income are subject to larger excess risks by nonadherence. This highlights the potential importance of promoting medication adherence for risk reduction, especially in low‐income patients with hypertension. [[ref]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.013148)

### Race

As race is not a genetic construct, many of the health disparities seen between races are contingent on the unequal distribution of barriers to good heath faced by certain groups rather than race itself. When surveyed, respondents reported **economic instability**, **food insecurity** and **lack of support and transportation** as the top 3 barriers to good health [[ref]](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/07/2739081/0/en/Social-Threats-to-Aging-Well-in-America-2023-Survey-Reveals-Economic-Instability-Food-Insecurity-Lack-of-Support-and-Transportation-Access-as-Top-Barriers-to-Senior-Health.html)
