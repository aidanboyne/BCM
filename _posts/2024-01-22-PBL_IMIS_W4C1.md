## Vasculitis

Normal vessels are composed of intima (endothelial), media (smooth muscle), and adventitia (connective tissue). All vasculitities have nonspecific symptoms and are differentiated largley based on which organ is exhibiting symptoms of organ ischemia (via thrombosis or fibrotic healing).

![Normal Vessel Path](/img/Normal_vessel_path.jpg)

### Large vessel
Affect aorta or its major branches

#### Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis
- Granulomatus inflammation
- Narrowing of temporal arteries causes headache, jaw claudiacation, and potential blindness
- High ESR
- Dx via biopsy **but treat with high dose steroids before biopsy** to prevent blindness. Need to examine a large section of the vessel as it is a segmental disease. Negative biopsy does not exclude disease
- Elderly females

![Giant Cell](/img/giant_cell_arteritis.png)
_Note broad band of fibrotic tissue separating intima and media cauing luminal narrowing. There are also giant cells in left of image._

#### Takayasu's Arteritis
- Granulomatous inflammation of aortic arch and branches
- Young asian women
- Weak pulses in one arm, bruits over arteries, BP differences
- High ESR, treat with high dose steroids

### Medium Vessel

#### Kawasaki Disease
- Autoimmune attack of vessels
- Asian child
- Diffuse red rash on **_palms and soles _**which desquamates
- Enlarged cervical lymph nodes
- Strawberry tounge
- Fever and arthritis
- **_Can cause coronary aneurysms (MI)_**
- Treat with IVIG and aspirin (despite concern for Reye's syndrome!)
- Similar presentations to scarlet fever, but will usually not have the typical preceeding sore throat

#### Buerger Disease
- Male smokers
- Poor digital blood flow --> autoamputation and Raynaud's
- Superficial nodular phlebitis (tender veinous nodules)
- Segmental thrombosing vasculitis
- Treat by smoking cessation (will not save necrosed tissue but prevents )

#### Polyarteritis Nodosa
- **Lungs are spared**
- Type III hypersensitivity (immune complexes)
- Hep B+
- Motor and sensory deficits
- Renal Failure and HTN from renal artery stenosis
- Nodules, purpura
- Can lead to aneurysims and constrictions, especially in kidney, liver, and mesenteric arteries (rosary sign)
- Transmural fibrinoid **necrosis** of medium vessels
- Dx via angiogram or biopsy
- Treat with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide

_Note the bright pink fibrinoid necrosis_

### Small Vessel

#### Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (IgA)
- Most common childhood vasculitis, often following URI due to high level of IgA produced in mucosal sites during infection
- Associated with IgA complex deposition and **IgA nephropathy**
- C3 complement deposition
- **Palpable purpura on buttocks/legs**, abdominal pain and melena, nephritis
- Dx via tissue biopsy
- Usually self limited, can lead to renal failure and may be treated with steroids/cyclophosphamide in severe cases
 

## ANCA (Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) Vasculities [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-020-0204-y)

_Note_: these are still small vessel vasculitis

### Intro

All have some pulmonary and renal (crescentic MPGN/RPGN with pauci-immune staining, proteinuria and hematuria) involvement. ANCA are autoantibodies that attack neutrophl proteins and cause inappropriate neutrophil activation localized to microvascular beds resulting in further autoantigen release mediating T-cell injury. c-ANCA are cytoplamic and attack PR3. p-ANCA are perinuclear and attack MPO. Both are associated with loss of T and B cell tolerance. 

![ANCA_path](/img/ANCA_path.PNG)

In clinical practice, these antibodies are detected using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and various antigen-specific immunoassays, most commonly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for either PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA.

### Differentials

Although ANCAs are primarily associated with AAVs, a positive ANCA test by IIF occurs in other diseases, including infections such as tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in individuals with cystic fibrosis. PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA can occur in infective endocarditis, an important differential diagnosis as unwarranted immunosuppression in infective endocarditis has life-threatening consequences. An atypical ANCA pattern, resembling (but differing from) pANCA, can occur in gastrointestinal tract diseases, including ulcerative colitis, and some liver diseases. ANCAs can also occur in other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (notwithstanding the coexistence of AAV or AAV-like features in a minority of people with these diseases).

### Epidimiology
GPA is more common in europeans, while MPA is much more common in Asian patients. It has no sex predisposition, and occurs more in elderly patients. PTU and some other antithyroid drugs have been associated with ANCA vasculitis. Cocaine cut with levamisole is another risk factor.

### Sub-classifications

-**Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (p-ANCA)**: **_Asthma_**, sinusitis, and neuropathy refractory to medical therapy. Weight loss, eosinophilia and high IgE along with _p-ANCA elevations_ are also common but not absolutley necessary for dx. Palpable purpura. Granulomatous necrotizing small vessel vasculitis that can also involve heart, GI, and kidneys. (Used to be Churg-Strauss)
-**Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (c-ANCA)**: Sinusitis, otitis media, and hemoptysis with nodular lung infiltrates (**URI and LRI**). Weight loss, and hematuria with red cell casts are common. Palpable purpura with granulomas on biopsy. Conjunctival injection, eye pain, and diplopia are possible. (Used to be Wegener's)
    - The vasculitis and granulomatous inflammatory changes in the nasal lining leads to a loss of septal cartilage and, eventually, changes in the nasal and facial bones which can cause nasal flattening. Rhinoplasty in the presence of an autoimmune disorder such as GPA can be successful in restoring structure and cosmesis to the nose as well as in improving breathing. The operation is fraught with an increased complication rate due to the impaired blood supply caused by the vasculitis, the hypercoagulable state that is inherent in GPA and the immune modulating medications that patients are usually on.

    ![Wegeners](/img/wegeners.png)
-**Microscopic Polyangiitis (p-ANCA)**: Also hemoptysis, kidney failure, and purpura. However it does not have URI or granulomas and is p-ANCA (whose level correlates with disease activity) unlike Wegener's.

### Treatment

![Treatit](/img/treat_anca.png)

MTX or MMF are alternatives to CYC or RTX for induction therapy in non-organ-threatening disease, though long term outcomes are inferior. RTX is preferred induction agent over cyclophosphamide in patients such as children or adults where fertility preservation is important and in relapsing ANCA vasculitis. However, it is much more expensive. Prophylaxis against P. Jirovecii with TMP-SMX is reccomended. 

## Pharmacology
* **Acetaminophen**
* **Ondansetron**: selective 5-HT3 serotonin-receptor antagonist used for its antiemetic properties. It is one of the four FDA-approved 5-HT3 serotonin-receptor antagonists used to combat nausea and vomiting, including granisetron, dolasetron, and the second-generation drug, palonosetron. It acts centrally in the area postrema and peripherally on vagus nerve terminals. Potential adverse effects include headache, fatiuge, drowsiness, and QTc prolongation
* **Methylprednisolone**: intermediate acting systemic synthetic corticosteroid. mediates effects via binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptor, forming a complex that translocates to the nucleus inhibiting NF-kB expression and promoting anti-inflammatory gene products.
* **Cyclophosphamide**: nitrogen mustard alkylating agent causing non-cell cycle specific DNA and RNA cross linking. It is an immunosupressive agent selective to T-cells. Adverse effects include bladder and gonadal toxicity (i.e. hemorrhagic cystitis, amenorrhea, sterility), and myelosupression
* **Rituximab**: anti-CD20 monoclonal chimeric antibody causing selective B-cell depletion and reduction of antibody production. Many potential adverse effects including [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457173/)
    - Infusion reactions (allergic or anaphylactic) are extremely common
    - Increased risk of infection including reactivation of JCV (leading to PML), HSV, CMV, VSV, HEPB/C, and west nile.
    - Lymphopenia, and other -penias
    - TEN/SJS, paraneoplastic pemphigus, pruritis, alopecia...
    - Tumor lysis syndrome and acute renal failure
    - Respiratory infections
    - GI upset
    - Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
* **Azathioprine**: purine analog that converts into 6-MP and 6-TGN via metabolism by HPRT and TPMT enzymes. Metabolites are incorporated into replicating DNA and resulting in immunosupression. Complications include
    - Nausea
    - Fever, fatigue, arthralgias and myalgia
    - Cytopenias, including pancytopenia
    - Hepatotoxicity
    - Renal damage
    - Notably, patients taking allopurionol or feboxistat should recive lowered doses due to altered metabolism of AZA.
