## Compassion, Empathy, and Communication

Factors in Communication
 - Language
 - Senses
 - Health Literacy
 - Emotional/cognitive load
 - Social barriers (family present...)

Physician factors:
 - Don't use medical jargon
 - Allow some silence
 - Don't display discomfort with sensitive topics
 - Explain physical exams maneuvers and pequliar questions
 - Don't interrupt patient
 
## Survey Clinical exams
 - Observation
 - Inspection
 - Olfaction
 - Ascultation
 - Percussion
 - Palpation
 
Many types of physical exams: focused/systematic, superficial/thorough, symptom/diagnosis-directed. _Note:_ normal is broad range and relative

**Survey physical exam**: multi-system, non-comprehensive exam evaluating important anatomical and functional components.
 - Vitals
	- Temp: 95.5-99.9 (35.3-37.7C)
	- HR: 60*-90-100
	- BP: 90-120/50-80
	- RR: 12-24 bpm
	- O2sat: >95% room air
 - Genreal observations
 - Orientation: full name, where are we, what year, why are you in hospital... often find via interview w/o these questions. Can preface with "A couple silly questions"
 - Caillary refill, fingernails
	- blanch fingertip and estimate time for blood to return: normal is 2-3 seconds
	- clubbing (sign of heart/lung disease or cancer)
 - Radial pulses
	- palpable and symmetric in wrist arms, neck, groin, legs, feet (normal 2+)
	- some people (10%) no palpable radial pulse at baseline
 - Eyes, mouth throat
	- clear, no jaundice, infection, pallor of conjuctiva
	- Moist mucous membrane, no lesion, normal teeth (dentition), normal tongue... say ahhhh
 - Jugular distention
	- Venous pressure should be very low: RA pressure = central venous pressure. To gauge CVP, look at jugular venous pressure (JVP). Check neck reclined at 30deg.
 - Heart Valves
	- Relaxed heart = diastole
	- Pumping = systole
	- S1 "lub" = closure of mitral and tricuspid
	- S2 "dub" = closure of aortic and pulmonic valves
	- Listen at APTM spots
 - Lungs
	- Anterior: RUL, LUL, LLL, RLL
	- Posterior: 3 levels side to side LUL...
 - Abdomen
	- "Can I examine, help you lie back, let me put drape..."
	- Pull out foot rest
	- Xyphoid to pubic bone
	- Normal appearance: flat or rounded
	- Palpate for tenderness in 4 quadrants lightly then deeply. Should be soft and non-painful.
	- Look at face for pain/discomfort
 - Edema
	- Press slowly and check for cyanosis and pitting edema
 - Limb strength
	- Each limb: don't let me pull, dont let me push
	- Rate each limb 5/5
 
#### Intentional Observation

 - Conciousness
	- Alert --> Drowsy --> Obtunded --> Stuporous --> Comatose
 - Pain/discomfort
 - Body habitus and position
 - Respiratory effort 
 - Neuro (speech, language, gait...)
