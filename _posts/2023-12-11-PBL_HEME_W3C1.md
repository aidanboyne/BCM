# Microcytic Anemias

## Iron Deficiency [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2013/0115/p98.html)

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases.

Patients with iron deficiency anemia will present with
- A maximum MCV of 95
- Typically low ferritin (<30ng/mL)
- Increased TIBC
- Increased transferrin receptor
- Increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin
- Low bone marrow iron

They will not ever have high ferritin (> 100ng/mL), high serum iron, high transferrin sat., or decreased TIBC.

#### Smear

- Microcytic and hypochromic RBCs with marked anisopoikilocytosis in chronic cases of iron deficiency anemia
- Platelets may be increased (reactive thrombocytosis) (Am J Hematol 2014;89:524)
- Target cells are absent, unlike in thalassemia
- In more acute cases, dimorphic population of RBCs with increased RDW is the earliest evidence of iron deficient erythropoiesis
- Basophilic stippling occurs because of imperfect ribonucleic acid (RNA) resolution and abnormal ribosomal structure, and it reflects haemoglobin composition, heme, and combined iron disorder.

### Treatment
- Oral iron is first line treatment
- If not tolerated, IV iron should be initiated
- If CBC is not improved, reevaluate cause and consider IV iron. Transfuse if needed

Oral iron can be discontinued three months after hematocrit and ferritin levels normalize. 

## Thalessemias

Thalassemias are a group of inherited genetic blood disorders in which the body cannot make enough of the globin chains that form the backbone of the hemoglobin molecule. The two main forms of thalassemia are α-thalassemia, in which the patient cannot make enough α chains, and β-thalassemia, in which the patient cannot make enough β chains.

Thalassemias are more common in patients of Mediterranean descent and in patients from the Mediterranean, West Africa, Middle East, and Southeast Asian regions. In the United States, 85% of patients with α-thalassemia are of Asian descent, while the disorder is uncommon in Caucasians. β-Thalassemia has a high prevalence worldwide, including a 10% prevalence in malaria-endemic areas of Africa and Asia, where the trait might be protective against the malaria parasite, just as in sickle cell disease.

#### Alpha Thalessemia

![Alpha](/img/alpha_thal.PNG)

Unpaired beta chains form HbH, or H bodies. In fetus, they consist of gamma chains called Hb barts.

#### Beta Thalessemia

![Beta](/img/beta_thas.PNG)

Complete lack of beta chains typically results in death by age 5 unless they can get a stem cell transplant. Beta thalessemia may be asymtomatic at birth as HbF is predominant. Patients with severe thalessima show symptoms by 6 months.

Both thalassemias may present with hepatosplenomegaly, thickened skull and face, target cells, nucleated RBCs, and abnormal electrophoresis (high HbA2, HbF). Can be cured with stem cell transplants or gene therapy. Transfusion can bridge gap to definitive treatment, but requires monitoring of iron levels and chelation to avoid iron overload. 

Alpha thalassemia is prevalent in Asian and African populations while beta-thalassemia is more prevalent in the Mediterranean population, although it is relatively common in Southeast Asia and Africa too. Prevalence in these regions may be as high as 10%.

## Sideroblastic Anemias


# Sickle Cell Disease

Vaso-occlusive phenomena and hemolysis are the clinical hallmarks of sickle cell disease (SCD). Vaso-occlusion results in recurrent painful episodes (previously called sickle cell crisis) and a variety of serious organ system complications that can lead to life-long disabilities and even death. Hemolysis of red blood cells (RBC) causes chronic anemia and pigment gallstones

### Complications

1. Bacterial and viral infections due to functional asplenia. Immunization is essential, and prophylactic penicillin for children <5y.o. is highly reccomended. Pediatric fever >38.5C (101.5F) should be considered a medical emergency, as infection is the leading cause of death in children with sickle cell. Encapsulated organisms such as Strep. Pneumo and H. Flu are most common. 
2. Severe anemias due to splenic sequestration, aplastic crisis, or hyperhemolysis. Normally, SCD patients have adaptive low hememoglobin (8-10 g/dL), low hematocrit (20-30%), high reticulocytes (3-15%). May also show HJ bodies in addition to sickled cells on smear. Parovirus B19 can cause aplastic crisis. Infants are at highest risk of splenic sequestration crisis and may require splenectomy to prevent recurrence. 
3. Vaso-occlusive phenomena
    - Acute painful episodes (previously crisis): triggered by cold, wind, low humiditiy, dehydration, stress, alcohol, menses... Provider misconceptions about nature and severity of SCD pain are common. Managed with opiods and preventatiave measures
    - Stroke: 11% by 20y.o. without intervention. Ischemic more common in children, Hemorrhagic more common in adults. 
    - ACS: fever, chest pain, hypoxemia, wheeze, cough, with new pulmonary infiltrate. Major cause of mortality. Requires analgesia, oxygen, bronchodilators, and transfusion.
    - Asthma
    - Kidney infarct: 1/5 of patients develop CKD. Avoid nephrotoxic meds and chronic NSAID use. 
    - Dactylitis/bone infarct: often in children. Hydroxyurea is quite good for this.
    - MI
    - Pregnancy complications
    - Priapism
    - Venous thromboembolism
4. Pulmonary hypertension and sleep disordered breathing: PH more common than general population. SDB in 79% of children and 44% of adults. 
5. Hypertension
6. Osteoperosis: supplement vitamin D and start bone density screening early
7. Pigmented gallstones
8. Delayed growth and puberty
9. Chronic leg ulcers
10. Proliferative retinopathy

### Managing Crisis

- Rapid and thorough assessment – For those who present to the emergency department or day hospital, there should be rapid assessment of pain and SCD comorbidities that may require additional treatment. (See 'Clinical assessment of pain' below and 'Possible contributing comorbidities' below.)
- Rapid and effective analgesia – Analgesia should be provided rapidly and its efficacy assessed frequently. Individuals whose pain is not adequately treated should be admitted to the hospital for continuous opioids (preferably using patient-controlled analgesia [PCA]). As noted in the 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline, standardized protocols are useful to ensure rapid analgesia for all individuals with sickle cell disease. (See 'Initial pain control' below and 'Continuous opioids/patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)' below.)

The gold standard for assessment of pain is the individual's (or family's) report; no combination of clinical and laboratory findings exists to determine (or confirm) whether an individual with SCD is in pain. Specifically, the absence of hemolysis or stability of the hemoglobin level should not be used to justify withholding of pain medication or administration of a lower dose. This is especially true in individuals with hemoglobin SC (Hb SC) disease, whose pain episodes may be triggered by hyperviscosity and who may present with a low-normal or normal hemoglobin level. Failure to adequately assess and appreciate the intensity and cause(s) of pain may lead to unnecessary withholding of opioids, which in turn may worsen pain and coping mechanisms.

### Hydroxyurea [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022916/)

Only drug proven to reduce painful episodes. ABout 50% decrease in ACS and blood transfusions in adults. May also prevent or reverse chronic organ damage from SCA. 

The mechanism by which hydroxyurea increases HbF remain unclear. Suspected mechanisms include inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, which thus inhibits S-phase DNA synthesis in a cyclical manner which affects erythropoeisis mechanics.

Hydroxyurea also reduces neutrophils, reticulocytes, and platelets, which may help with some SCD symptoms. 

### Chronic Management 
- Supplementation with multivitamin without iron.
- Appropriate chelation with transfusions


# Lead Poisoning

### Exposure
- Ingestion of lead containing dust is major source of lead exposure in children. Includes contaminated paint and soil. 
- Paint prior to 1978 in the US may have lead. Over 3 million homes with children < 6y.o. still contain lead paint in the US. Resource limited countries still have high reates of lead exposure.
- Water: lead solder with copper ppies is common source. 
- Other: pottery, cosmetics, costume jewlery, imported spices.

Southeast asia has the highest rate of lead poisoning. 

### Clinical manifestations

No safe level of lead exists. Lead is distributed throughout body tissues, and has a long half life in bone (> 25 years). Children retain and absorb more lead than adults. 

High lead exposure has been indicated to cause lower IQ. High levels can cause encephalopathy with accompanying vomiting, altered conciousness, ataxia, seizure, and or coma. Hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy is also possible. Nephropathy, lead colic (sporadic vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain) are other manifestations.

Symptoms of lead poisoning are often non-specific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, back pain, paresthesias, limb weakness, and malaise. In severe cases, patients may present with encephalopathy. Without a history of exposure, lead poisoning has been mistaken for acute viral illness, sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis, gastro-enteritis, acute appendicitis, nephrolithiasis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2002/1115/p1839.html)

Lead poisoning in children rarely results in anemia. However, lead does decrease hemoglobin synthesis (via ferrochelatase and ALAD inhibition) and increased hemolysis.

* Lowest exposure: Impaired abilities (patients may be asymptomatic)
    * Decreased learning and memory
    * Decreased verbal ability
    * Early signs of hyperactivity or ADHD
    * Lowered IQ
    * Impaired speech and hearing functions
* Low exposure
    * Myalgia or paresthesia
    * Mild fatigue
    * Irritability
    * Lethargy
    * Occasional abdominal discomfort
* Moderate exposure
    * Arthralgia
    * General fatigue
    * Difficulty concentrating
    * Muscular exhaustibility
    * Tremor
    * Headache
    * Diffuse abdominal pain
    * Vomiting
    * Weight loss
    * Constipation
* High exposure
    * Paresis or paralysis
    * Encephalopathy
    * May abruptly lead to seizures, changesin consciousness, coma, and death
    * Lead line (blue-black) on gingival tissue
    * Colic (intermittent, severe abdominal cramps)

### Management

Elimination of exposure should be the primary intervention in all cases. 

- Adequate nutritional intake of calcium, vitamin C, and iron along with regular meals should be routinely recommended to minimize lead absorption and prevent pica. Fasting should be avoided because it increases intestinal lead absorption 
- Retesting should be preformed if leavels are over 15 mcg/dL to ensure that BLL is not rapidly increasing. Patients with BLL <45 should _not_ recived chelation, as it has not been shown to improve outcomes despite transiently reduced BLL.
- Levels over 45 should have confirmitory test within 48 hours with abdominal X-ray to identify lead paint chips or leaded foreign bodies. GI decontamination should be preformed if lead is ID'd on X-ray. Patients should recive chelation as soon as BLL is confirmed with succimer rather than IV CaNa2EDTA if possible. This should be done in the hospital until lead-containing environment is ID'd. 
- Patients with symptoms, especially encephalopathy, require rapid chelation via combined dimercaprol and CaNa2EDTA. 

#### Chelating agents
- Succimer: PO agent for asymptomatic lead poisoning. Specific to Pb and few adverse effects
- CaNa2EDTA: Increases urinary excretion of lead. Should be administered AFTER dimercaprol in encephalopathy. IV agent.
- Dimercaprol: be careful in penut allergy. Deep IM injection. HTN, tachycardia, and fever are common adverse effects.

### Drug Seeking Behavior

Benzodiazepines and opioids are the two most common classes associated with drug-seeking behaviour. Psychotropic drugs producing stimulant effects, euphoria, sedation or hallucinatory effects are sometimes sought. These include the newer antipsychotics quetiapine and olanzapine, and stimulants such as dexamphetamine and methylphenidate. Anabolic steroids are also increasingly misused. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919169/)

The most commonly co-administered drugs included benzodiazepines, alcohol and other opioids which in combination can cause respiratory depression. Approximately 12% of deaths were identified as due to oxycodone toxicity alone.

**Indicators of drug-seeking behaviours**

* Typical requests and complaints
    * Aggressively complaining about a need for a drug
    * Asking for specific drugs by name
    * Asking for brand names
    * Requesting to have the dose increased
    * Claiming multiple allergies to alternative drugs
    * Anger or irritability when questioned closely about symptoms such as pain
    * Inappropriate self-medicating
    * Taking a few extra, unauthorised doses on occasion
    * Hoarding drugs
    * Using a controlled substance for non-pain relief purposes (e.g. to enhance mood, aid sleep)
    * Injecting an oral formulation
* Inappropriate use of general practice
    * Visiting multiple doctors for controlled substances (doctor shopping)
    * Frequently calling the clinic
    * Frequent unscheduled clinic visits for early refills
    * Consistently disruptive behaviour when arriving at the clinic
    * Consistently calling outside of clinic hours or when a particular doctor who prescribes controlled substances is on call
    * Resistant behaviour
    * Unwilling to consider other drugs or non-drug treatments
    * Frequent unauthorised dose escalations after being told that it is inappropriate
    * Unwilling to sign controlled substances agreement
    * Refusing diagnostic workup or consultation
* Manipulative or illegal behaviour
    * Claiming to be on a waiting list for, or unable to afford, dental work and needing to manage dental pain
    * Obtaining controlled drugs from family members (including stealing from older relatives)
    * Using aliases
    * Forging prescriptions
    * Pattern of lost or stolen prescriptions
    * Selling drugs
    * Obtaining controlled drugs from illicit sources
* Other typical behaviours
    * Being more concerned about the drug than a medical problem
    * Deterioration at home or work or reduction of social activities because of adverse drug effects

### Establishing care for Immigrants [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480259/)

In the United States, 1 in 4 children lives in an immigrant family. State and national policies have historically precluded equitable access to health care among children in immigrant families. More recently, increasingly restrictive policies, political rhetoric, and xenophobic stances have made immigrant families less able to access health care and less comfortable in attempting to do so, thus increasing the likelihood that patients will present to the emergency department.
