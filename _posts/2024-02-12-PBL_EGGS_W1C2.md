## Thyroid Physiology

# Hyperthyroidism

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Gravesâ€™ disease, followed by toxic nodular goitre. Other important causes of thyrotoxicosis include thyroiditis, iodine-induced and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction, and factitious ingestion of excess thyroid hormones.

### Clinical presentation

Symptoms include anxiety, weight loss, palpitations and insomnia. Elderly patients tend to present with cardiovascular symptoms ranging from sinus tachycardia to atrial fibrillation and heart failure. In younger patients (<50 years of age), neurogenic symptoms, such as tremor and anxiety, predominate; in some cases, overt psychosis can occur. 

A distinct feature of GD may be the sudden onset of symptoms compared with the slow and indolent course of toxic multinodular goitre. In GD, the presence of extrathyroidal manifestations, such as GO, is often associated with a more severe degree of hyperthyroidism and a larger goitre.

### Diagnosis

Differential for hyperthyroidism includes the following:

Radioiodine scintigraphy is useful for diagnosis as shown below:

    _A) Graves, B) Destructive thyrotoxicosis, C) Toxic adenoma, D) Toxic multinodular goitre_



## Thyroid Storm

Life threatening hyperthyroidism usually precipitated by an acute event such as surgery, trauma, or infection, or by a pre-existing hyperthyroid disease such as those listed below. Massive catecholamine surge causes fever, delirium, and tachycardia (often with deadly arrhythmia) alongside hyperglycemia and hypercalcemia.

### Grave's Disease [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-020-0184-y)

Autoantibodies against TSHR agonize follicular cells, causing excess thyroid hormone secretion outside of pituitary control. The autoantibodies can also cause Grave's orbitopathy (GO) and pretibial myxoedema (alongside synergism with IGF1R). These non-thyroid manifestations are thought to be due to T-cell activation of fibroblasts.

GD primarily affects women (10:1) and is not correlated to iodine intake (unlike multinodular goiter) and is instead likley liked to genetic factors including CTLA4, PTPN22, FOXP3 and other immune regulatory genes. Smoking is a risk factor (esp. for GO). Postpartum women, and those with major stress are also at higher risk.

Histology demonstrates lymphocytic infiltrate of thyroid and hypertorphied follicular cells. GD presents with diffuse goitre and the diagnosis is often confirmed via serum TSH and FT4 levels along with an assay for TSHRAb. Negative Ab should be followed by radioiodine uptake and scan: diffuse uptake suggests GD while low or now uptake suggests destructive or factitious thyrotoxicosis or struma ovarii. Ultrasonography is useful to exclude the presence of thyroid nodules in all new patients.

Diagnosis in the case of pregnancy is extremely difficult if TSHRAb results are negative, and the disease may actually regress during pregnancy as immune tolerance develops.

#### Treatment
- Symptomatic relief via beta blockers should be started as soon as hyperthyroidism is diagnosed to target a BPM of 60-90.
- Medication includes thionamides like methimazole (and PTU, though it has fallen out of favor except during first trimester). Methimazole has long DOA and less side effects (such as hepatotoxicity and particularly granulocytopenia). Treatment is often continued for at least 12 months.
- Radioiodine is great for small goiters in patients who should not or are not well controlled on thionamides. Na<sup>131</sup>I is given orrally and concentrates in the thyroid, ablating the gland. Patietns will then require thyroid hormone replacement.
- Surgery (total is preferred) is good for large goitre patients and those with severe GO. It has the lowest incidence of relapse.

### Viral Thyroiditis

Initial thyroiditis causes hyperthyroidism as TH are released into the plasma due to inflammation. However, over time a persistent infection will reduce the ability of the thyroid to create TH, leading to hypothyroidism.

### Toxic Multinodular Goiter

Palpable nodules which typically have mutated TSH receptors which do not respond to the hormone. A single nodule is known as toxic adenoma. Can be distinguished from cancerous nodule via radioactive iodine uptake. Hot nodules are not cancerous, while cold nodules have a small chance of cancer and should be biopsied via FNA. 

### Jod-Basedow

Introduciton of iodine in teh context of iodine deficiency or toxic adenoma can cause sudden, excessive thyroid hormone production. 

### Drugs
- Amioderone
    - Type I: pre-existing disease uses iodine to create excess TH
    - Type II: direct toxic drug effect causes destructive thyroiditis and accompanying acute hyperthyroidism.

# Hypothyroidism

Interestingly, around 7% of the US population has a prescription for LT4.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis

Massive lymphocytic infiltrate and Hurthle cells on biopsy. Occurs primarily in women who develop an enlarged non-tender thyroid gland alongside gradual loss of thyroid function.

If it goes away in a few weeks, it is called painless or limited thyroiditis.

### Other causes
- **Granulomatous thyroiditis**: tender enlarging thyroid due to granulomatous inflammation. Typically in young femals and results in hyper --> eu --> hypothyroid cycle. Treat with NSAIDs, aspirin, steroids... Usually resolves in weeks.
- **Riedel thyroiditis**: Fibroblast activation and proliferation causes _**rock hard**_ thyroid. Often involves parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism), recurrent laryngeal nerves (hoarseness), and tracheal compression (difficulty breathing). Thought to by IgG4 plasma cells.
- **Congenital**: Can result in cretinism if not addressed early. Most commonly due to thyroid dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, ectopy) or dyshormonogenesis (abnormal TH synthesis i.e. mutations in TPO) in iodine-sufficient regions. Results in pot-bellied, pale, puffy faced child with protruding umbilicus, large tounge, and intellectual disabilities.
- **Iodine deficiency**: not enout iodine to create TH causes very high TSH and thyroid hypertrophy --> goiter
    - Other goitrogens include lithium, cassava, and millet
- **Wolff-Chaikoff**: Organification inhibitied by excess iodine via reduced MIT, DIT produciton
- **Euthyroid sick syndrome**: Low TSH despite low TH due to some underlying critical illness.
- **Amioderone**: excess iodine via Wolff-Chaikoff. Pre-existing subclinical thyroid disease can cause failure to escape. It also inhibits 5'-diodinase which can cause peripheral hypothyroidism. 
- **Iatrogenic**: thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, neck radiation for hodgkin's or head/neck cancers.
