## Self Regulated Learning
Iterative cycle which includes:
 - Planning phase: prepping to learn new material
	- Task analysis: set goals and plan strats
	- Self-motivational beliefs: self efficacy, outcome expectation, and intrinsic interest
 - Performance phase: actual studying process
	- Self-control: attention focusing and task strats
	- Self-observation: monitoring yourself and experimenting
 - Reflection phase: compare between goals and objective standards. Find what contributed to the outcome and engage in active identification of modifiable factors.
 
## Ambiguity in Medicine

Ambiguity is inevitable, but a lack of tolerance toward uncertainty leads to:
 - innefective communication
 - increased cognitive bias
 - inappropriate (diagnositc) resource use
 - burnout, depression, and decreased mental health
 
#### Managing uncertainty
 - Diagnose the uncertainty: what is knowable and minimize unnecessary uncertainty
 - Plan for uncertainty: what if I am right and what if I am wrong - follow up with patients
 - Discuss uncertainty openly
 - Don't worry alone: may be multiple treatments, accept fallibility and seek help if needed

#### Tips
 - Review material on patient writeup for exam.
 - Go to `SOAR` for research projects
 - Check out ADEG
