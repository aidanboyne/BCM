## Normal Infant and Child Development

![Development Mile](/img/development_milestone.png)

In the first 6 months, the children with autism show typical acquisition of milestones, whereas by 9 months of age they began to fail the language/communication, as well as motor items when compared to typical and delayed non-autistic children. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29594925)

#### How Much Sleep? [[ref]](https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/pediatricsleepdurationconsensus.pdf)

| Age Group  | Age         | Recommended Hours of Sleep             |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Infant     | 4-12 months | 12-16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) |
| Toddler    | 1-2 years   | 11-14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) |
| Pre-School | 3-5 years   | 10-13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) |
| School Age | 6-12 years  | 9-12 hours per 24 hours                   |
| Teen       | 13-18 years | 8-10 hours per 24 hours                   |
| Adult      | 18-60 years | 7 or more hours per night                 |

Both autism spectrum disorder and ADHD are classified under the communication disorders section of the DSM5. Communication includes any verbal or nonverbal behavior (whether intentional or unintentional) that has the potential to influence the behavior, ideas, or attitudes of another individual. Assessments of speech, language, and communication abilities must take into account the individual's cultural and language context, particularly for individuals growing up in bilingual environments. The standardized measures of language development and of nonverbal intellectual capacity must be relevant for the cultural and linguistic group. [[ref]](https://www.mredscircleoftrust.com/storage/app/media/DSM%205%20TR.pdf)

## Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism is marked by deficits in reccipricol social communicaiton and interaction alongsite restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activity which limit or impair everyday functioning. The prevalance in the US is roughly 1-2%, with higher prevalence in white children not accounted for by socioeconomic factors. Male to female incidence is approximatley 3:1.

### Risk Factors

Environmental factors include advanced paternal age, extreme prematuratiy, and exposure to teratogens in utero (e.g. valproic acid). Heretibility estimates vary, but is thought to be around 80%. Known mutations are associated with 15% of cases. 

### Diagnosis

To meet diagnostic criteria for ASD according to DSM-5, a child must have persistent deficits in each of three areas of social communication and interaction plus at least two of four types of restricted, repetitive behaviors. [[ref]](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html)

#### Social Deficits

* Deficits in **social-emotional reciprocity**, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.
* Deficits in **nonverbal communicative behaviors** used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.
* Deficits in **developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships**, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.

#### Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors
* **Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements**, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypes, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
* **Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior** (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day).
* **Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus** (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests).
* **Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment** (e.g. apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).

_The above list is not exhaustive_. For each criterion, the severity is classified in 3 levels:
1. Requires support
2. Requires substatntial support
3. Requires very substantial support

The diagnosis should also specify if there is intellectual or language impairment, association with a known genetic, medical, or environmental factor, catatonia, or association with a neurodevelopmental or behavioral problem. 

The symptoms must present in early developent, cause clinically significant social or occupational impairment, and not be better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay.

    American Psychiatric Association. (2022). Autism Spectrum Disorder. In Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed., text rev.).

#### Differential

- ADHD: similar attention abnormalities. However, communication deficits in ADHD are more interruptive than restrictive. Also, ADHD lacks restricted, repetitive behaviors and unusual interest. Concurrent diagnosis should be considered with attention and hyperactivity is noted in ASD patients, and the comorbidity is quite common. 
- Intellectual Disibility: distinguish as in ASD, social communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills.
- Language disorders and selective mutism: early development is often not disturbed, and appropriate nonverbal social communication patterns are OK. Patients with selective mutism will typically exhibit appropriate social communication skills in some environments.
- Rett syndrome: especially hard to distinguish in girls between 1-4 during the regressive phase. However, those with Rett usually improve social communication after this period.
- Anxiety disorders: specific phobia and social anxiety/agoraphobia co-occur with ASD in many cases
- OCD: repetitive thoughts/actions in OCD  are often related to contamination, organization, or sexual or religious themes. Autistic behaviors more often include motor actions (flapping), and insistence on strict routines and patients may enjoy these behaviors and routines unlike in OCD.


#### Prognosis

Autism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is typical for learning and compensation to continue throughout life. Nonetheless, those with the disorder may remain socially naive and vulnerable, have difficulties organizing practical demands without aid, and are prone to anxiety and depression. Many adults report using compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their difficulties in public but suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a socially acceptable facade. Patients also have a higher risk of suicide.

#### Treatment [[ref]](https://aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/1115/p629.html)

Early intervention usually includes applied behavior analysis, which focuses on learning and reinforcing acceptable behaviors while extinguishing problematic behaviors. Applied behavior analysis improves cognitive skills and behavior but is an intensive process that typically requires many hours per week of patient participation. Early intervention that includes applied behavior analysis improves cognitive functioning and language skills, with better results from more intense therapy.

Nearly all children with ASD require school-based assistance through an individualized education program, which often includes educational interventions, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. Up to 30% of children with ASD never acquire verbal speech; some will use augmented and alternative communication that includes a picture exchange communication system or speech-generating devices. About two-thirds of preschool children with ASD require occupational therapy for motor, strength, and adaptive skills.

Other treatments proposed for ASD, including antifungal agents, immunotherapy, or hyperbaric oxygen, do not have evidence of benefit. There is caution against using chelation therapy because of ineffectiveness and a risk of harm. Discussing treatments with little or negative evidence often requires shared decision-making with parents or caregivers.

## Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. 

_Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required._

ADHD is present in about 7.2% of children and 2.5% of adults worldwide. The prevalance is higher in foster children or individuals in correctional settings. ADHD is typically diagnosed in the elementary school years. It is associated with low inhibition, negative emotionality, low birth weight/prematurity, prenatal smoking, in utero exposures (lead, viral encephalitis, alcohol), and genetics (74% heritability, polygenic). 

THe disorder is identified less often in black and hispanic populations in the US, and less often in females. 

#### Inattention

Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:

1. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).
2. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
3. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
4. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).
5. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
6. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
7. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).
8. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
9. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).

#### Hyperactivity and impulsivity
Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:

1. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
2. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place).
3. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
4. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
5. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
6. Often talks excessively.
7. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
8. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).
9. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing).

Several of the symptoms must be present prior to age 12, occur in multiple settings, and clearly interfere with social/academic/occupational function. They must not only occur in the course of another psychotic or mental disorder.

ADHD should be specified as **combined**, **predominantly inattentive**, or **predominantly hyperactive/impulsive**. Partial remission, and severity of symptoms should also be noted.

#### Differential 
- ODD: problem of conformity rather than attention. More negative, hostile, defiant behavior than ADHD.
- Interittent Explosive Disorder: serious agression is not seen in ADHD
- ASD: see ASD section
- Anxiety disorders: symptoms in ADHD not associated with worry and rumination
- PTSD: must be ruled out with comprehensive assessment of exposure to traumatic events.
- Bipolar/MDD: symptoms here only exhibited during episodes. Overall less common in children.
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: pervasive irratability is the defining factor. Usually occurs in conjunction with ADHD.
- Personality disorders: difficult to distinguish in adolescents and adults. May require detailed history and informant interview

#### Prognosis

ADHD is associated with reduced acatemic attainment, job stability, occupational performance, and higher interpersonal conflict. ADHD is also associated with higher all-cause mortality, largley due to accidents and injuries.

#### Treatment

For preschool children (age 4 through 5 years) who meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, we recommend parent (caregiver) training in behavior management (PTBM; also known as behavior therapy) rather than medication as the initial therapy. The addition of medication to behavior therapy may be indicated if target behaviors do not improve with behavioral therapy alone and the child's function continues to be impaired. 

School age children can be managed initially with stimulant medication + PTBM. Parent (or caregiver) training in behavior management (PTBM) is aimed at improving parent-child relationships through enhanced parenting techniques via things like:
- Maintaining a daily scheducle
- Lowering environmental distractions
- Setting small gaols
- Limiting choices
- Using calm discipline

Psychotherapy interventions are distinct from behavioral interventions. Psychotherapy interventions are directed toward the child (rather than the caregiver or environment) and designed to change the child's emotional status (eg, play therapy) or thought patterns (eg, cognitive-behavior therapy, cognitive therapy). These are generally not helpful as they have been shown to have poor transferability to classroom or home environments. 

Pharmacological treatments include:
- **Stimulants**: methylphenidates and amphetamines. Require schedule II prescription. 
- **Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: atomoxetine, viloxazine
- **Alpha-2-Adrenergic Agonists**: poor responders to stimulants and SNRIs can trial clonidine or guanfacine. It takes up to 2 weeks before response is seen.
- **Tricyclics and dopamine reuptake inhibitors**: these antidepressants are not FDA approved but have been used in poor responders to stimulants and SNRIs.

### Diagnostic Scales

- **Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder parent Rating Scale (VADPRS)**: The Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS) is an ADHD rating scale developed to provide efficient and useful diagnostic assistance. The 55-item VADPRS consists of 18 DSM-IV ADHD symptom items as well as subscales that screen for 8 ODD behaviors, 14 CD behaviors, and 7 anxiety or depression behaviors, all on a 4-point scale of frequency (0 = never, 3 = very often). An additional functioning subscale consists of eight items which examine academic performance and relationships on a 5-point scale (1 = above average performance, 5= problematic performance) to help establish that a child meets diagnostic criteria for ADHD. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9172842/)
- **Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED)**: 41 questions to be completed by the child and parent. The items are scored as 0 (never/rarley true), 1 (sometimes true), or 2 (often true). A total score of ≥ 25 may indicate the presence of an
Anxiety Disorder. Scores higher than 30 are more
specific. Adding scores for specific items can indicate more specific disorders such as GAD, separation anxiety, and panic disorder [[ref]](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/SCARED-form-Parent-and-Child-version.pdf). 

### Accomodations
- **Section 504 Plan**: 504 applies when a disability substantially limits a major life function, including learning. When a student is being excluded from an activity due to disability a 504 Plan is needed to provide accommodations and supports to access both academic and extra-curricular activities. The 504 Plan developed for any given student MUST address services needed to access and participate in the learning process offered to grade-appropriate peers.
- **IEP**: Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA), a student must have a specific disability as defined in law and must need special education services for IEP to apply. An Individualized Education Program (IEP) must be developed by an IEP team and in place for each student with a disability identified under IDEA. The plan includes measurable learning goals, accommodations and/or modifications, how progress will be measured, and related services, as applicable. 

#### Case Meds and Details
- **Methylphenidate**: Indicated for primary ADHD treatment and secondary narcolepsy treatment. Children must be at least 6 before starting. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482451/)
    - MOA: Presynaptic norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. This increased cleft concentration and thus acts as a CNS stimulate, primarily in the prefrontal cortex. It is also a weat 5HT1A agonist.
    - Therepeutic dosages are not high enough to activate the addiction/reward system. However, misuse can result in addiction.
    - Side effects include growth retardation, dizziness, headache, restlessness, GI issues, and palpitations. Methylphenidate should be avoided in patients with structural cardiac issues or arrythmias. Contraindicated with MAOIs and Tourette's.
- **Tympanostomy Tube Placement**: A recent study examined the rate of TTP in children with ADD. The authors found that approximately 1 in 6 children with ASD underwent TTP, more than double the rate in the general population. The rate may simply be higher because physicians are swift to perform TTP in children at risk for speech delay. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22343482/)
- **Barriers to ASD diagnosis**: Profound disparities exist in access to diagnostic and treatment services for children with autism: children who are low-income, have low parental educational attainment, or are from minoritized racial/ethnic backgrounds experience diagnostic delays, and are less likely to receive treatment after diagnosis.
