# Pancytopenia

### Normal Hematopoiesis

![Hematopoiesis](/img/Hematopoiesis.png)

### Etiology [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563146/)

- **Decreased production (central type)**: Pancytopenia due to decreased production is mainly secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Pancytopenia caused by bone marrow failure is known as **aplastic anemia**. Aplastic anemia could be idiopathic/autoimmune, secondary to infections (such as parvovirus B19, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus), after drug toxicity, or chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, dapsone, carbimazole, carbamazepine, chloramphenicol). Pancytopenia can also be related to inadequate intake (as seen in eating disorders and alcoholics) or malabsorption.
    - EBV pancytopenia:  EBV induces proliferation of virus-specific CTLs and decreases the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, causing a immune-mediated process involving overactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that target bone marrow and cause hematopoietic dysfunction. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5976969/)
- **Bone marrow infiltration/replacement**: The production of cell lines is also impaired when the bone marrow is infiltrated by malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma) or granulomatous disorders. Metastatic tumors can also cause bone marrow replacement late in the disease, thus producing pancytopenia.
- **Increased destruction (peripheral type)**: Peripheral destruction of cells can be associated with many autoimmune conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) and splenic sequestration (alcoholic liver cirrhosis, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria). Hypersplenism affects platelets and erythrocytes more than leukocytes.

In North America, the most common etiologies are myeloid neoplasms (acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia), followed by aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, and HIV infections.

### Presentation

Patients can present with manifestations of any of the decreased cell lines. Anemia can present as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. Leukopenia manifests as increased infections, while thrombocytopenia presents with bruising, petechiae, and a propensity for bleeding. Patients with severe neutropenia can present with severe infections. Patients with underlying liver disease can present with anorexia, nausea, or lethargy. Patients with splenic sequestration can present with left upper quadrant pain. Constitutional symptoms can be seen in patients with underlying autoimmune disorders or malignancies.

Physical examination may reveal pallor, petechiae, ulcers, and rash. Signs of underlying liver disease may be seen in patients with cirrhosis. Splenomegaly may be seen in patients with splenic sequestration. Lymphadenopathy can be seen in patients with infections and lymphoma. Attention must be paid to signs of nutritional deficiencies in patients with eating disorders and alcoholism. The neurological examination is essential as it may show impairment of proprioception with a positive Romberg test and ataxia, suggesting subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord secondary to vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency and macrocytic anemia.

### Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection)

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widely disseminated herpesvirus that is spread by intimate contact between susceptible persons and asymptomatic EBV shedders. EBV is the primary agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM), persists asymptomatically for life in nearly all adults, and is associated with the development of B cell lymphomas, T cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinomas in certain patients. Reactivation disease is not a prominent issue with EBV, in contrast to other common herpesviruses, but it has been associated with an aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder in transplant recipients.

#### Complications
- **Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM)**: Severe fatigue with general malaise, headache, and fever followed by tonsillitis/pharyngitis with cervical lymph node enlargement. Often presents with peripheral lymphocytosis
- **Splenic rupture**: rare case in males that can occur without injury. Typically occurs in first 3 weeks of symptomatic injury.
- **Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV)**: lymphoproliferative disorder of B, T, and/or NK cells. Clinical manifestations may include fever, swelling of lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly along with liver function test abnormalities and **pancytopenia**
- EBV is also associated with MS, lymphoproliferative disorders such as hemophagic lymphohistocytosis, lemphomatoid granulomatosis, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, and most cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.
- EBC increases risk of Burkitt lymphoma, tumors in HIV potisive patients, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal, head, and neck carcinomas, gastric carcinomas, T-cell lymphomas, and nasal angiocentric lymphomas. 

### Case Tests
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Identifies morphological abnormalities in blood cells, aiding in the assessment of pancytopenia and revealing potential underlying bone marrow pathology.
- **Quantiferon Gold-TB test**: Helps exclude tuberculosis as a cause of pancytopenia, particularly important in regions where TB is prevalent.
- **Hepatitis panel**: Evaluates for hepatitis viruses (HBV and HCV), which can cause pancytopenia through direct viral effects on the bone marrow or immune-mediated mechanisms.
- **Viral tests (HIV, Parvovirus, CMV, COVID, and EBV)**: Assesses for viral infections that can lead to pancytopenia through various mechanisms, including direct viral invasion of hematopoietic cells or immune-mediated destruction.

_Note:_ Heroin use is mentioned in the case but is not associated with pancytopenia. Isolated thrombocytopenia, however, has been reported after IV heroin or cocaine use [[ref]](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.7326/0003-4819-89-2-207). Recent literature on the topic is lacking

## Transfusions

For an introduction to blood components and transfusion procedures, see [previous case](https://aidanboyne.github.io/BCM/posts/PBL_HEME_W1C1/). An excellent review article of transfusion in clinical practice is here: [JAY S. RAVAL, MD, JOSEPH R. GRIGGS, DO, AND ANTHONY FLEG, MD, MPH - **Blood Product Transfusion in Adults: Indications, Adverse Reactions, and Modifications**](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0701/p30.html#afp20200701p30-sort5)

In a "type and screen" procedure, the patient's red cells are typed for ABO and Rh (also known as D), and the patient's plasma is tested for clinically significant red cell antibodies.

A "type and crossmatch" involves selecting, matching, and reserving appropriate red cell components for the transfusion recipient. Many facilities have a Maximum Surgical Blood Ordering Schedule (MSBOS) that indicates when a type and screen are ordered and how many components should be reserved for each type of surgical procedure. Red cell antibodies of clinical significance are produced in response to pregnancy or transfusion; they can cause hemolysis or shortened survival of transfused red cells carrying the corresponding antigen (i.e., acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction).

### Indicaitons [[ref]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2011/0315/p719.html)

Indications for transfusion include symptomatic anemia (causing shortness of breath, dizziness, congestive heart failure, and decreased exercise tolerance), acute sickle cell crisis, and acute blood loss of more than 30 percent of blood volume. Fresh frozen plasma infusion can be used for reversal of anticoagulant effects. Platelet transfusion is indicated to prevent hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet function defects. Cryoprecipitate is used in cases of hypofibrinogenemia, which most often occurs in the setting of massive hemorrhage or consumptive coagulopathy. Transfusion-related infections are less common than noninfectious complications. All noninfectious complications of transfusion are classified as noninfectious serious hazards of transfusion. Acute complications occur within minutes to 24 hours of the transfusion, whereas delayed complications may develop days, months, or even years later.

Restrictive transfusion practices resulted in a 54 percent relative decrease in the number of units transfused and a reduction in the 30-day mortality rate. The authors recommended transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g per dL, and maintenance of a hemoglobin level between 7 to 9 g per dL. A recently updated Cochrane review supports the use of restrictive transfusion triggers in patients who do not have cardiac disease. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585033/)

### Transfusion Reactions

**Acute Transfusion Reactions**

1. Mild allergic: Attributed to hypersensitivity to a foreign protein in the donor product.
    - Incomplete transfusions associated with a mild allergic reaction may be resumed after symptom improvement. [[ref]](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article/151/3/344/5181337)
2. Anaphylactic: Similar to a mild allergic reaction, however resulting in a more severe reaction. Sometimes this can occur in a patient with IgA deficiency who makes alloantibodies against IgA and then receives blood products containing IgA.
3. Febrile non-hemolytic: Generally thought to be caused by cytokines released from blood donor leukocytes (white blood cells).
4. Septic: Caused by bacteria or bacterial byproducts (such as endotoxin) which may contaminate blood.
5. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions: Can result in intravascular or extravascular hemolysis, depending on the specific etiology (cause). Immune-mediated reactions are often a result of recipient antibodies present to blood donor antigens. Non-immune reactions are possible, and occur when red blood cells are damaged before transfusion (e.g., by heat or incorrect osmotic conditions).
6. Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO): Occurs when the volume of the transfused component causes hypervolemia (volume overload).
7. Transfusion-related acute lung injury: Acute lung injury is due to antibodies in the donor product (human leukocyte antigen or human neutrophil antigen) reacting with antigens in the recipient. The recipient’s immune system responds and causes the release of mediators that lead to pulmonary edema. Possibly contributing to this are clinical conditions that predispose the patient including infection, recent surgery, or inflammation.

**Delayed Transfusion Reactions**

1. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction: Typically caused by an anamnestic response to a foreign antigen that the patient was previously exposed to (generally by prior transfusion or pregnancy).
2. Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease: Results from engraftment of donor lymphocytes (commonly found in cellular blood products) into an immunocompromised recipient’s bone marrow. The donor lymphocytes recognize the patient as foreign and react against the recipient’s body

**Differential**: Acute myeloid leukemia, Von Willebrand disease, Celiac disease, Hypothyroidism

### Evaluation of Pancytopenia

The initial workup includes a complete blood count, along with a reticulocyte count. This will help to determine if the pancytopenia is secondary to decreased production. The mean corpuscular volume would point towards megaloblastic anemia. A peripheral blood smear can show abnormal cells such as blasts, dysplastic leukocytes, and immature cells. These abnormal cells may be related to conditions described in table 3. The diagnosis related to abnormal cells may require further investigations:

Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
Cytogenetic testing (fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] or karyotype) of bone marrow or peripheral blood
Flow cytometry of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood
Molecular studies (e.g., mutation analysis, gene expression profiling)
The workup should also include vitamin B12 and folate levels, liver chemistry, and lactate dehydrogenase.
Infectious workup should be done as pancytopenia can be associated with infections such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis.

### Phamaceuticals

- **Diphenhydramine**:  first-generation antihistamine that is used in a variety of conditions to treat and prevent dystonias, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, vertigo, and motion sickness. AKA Benedryl.
    - MOA: H1 receptor antagonist. Reverses increased vascular permeability, decreased AV conduction, chough, and eosinophilic chemotaxis promoted by H1 activiation.
        - Also acts as an antimuscarinic due to similarity between receptors
    - 1st gen antihistamines such as diphenhydramine cross blood-brain barrier into CNS, causing drowsiness and cough supression
    - Diphenhydramine also acts as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, leading to local anesthesis. 
    - Metabolized by CTP450
- **Famotidine**: competitive histamine H-receptor antagonist (H2RA). Decreases stomach acid production via binding to H2RA on basolateral membrane of parietal cells in the stomach. 
- **Methylprednisolone**: intermediate-acting synthetic glucocorticoid. Promotes expression of anti-inflammatory gene products and blocks function of inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-kB thus limiting inflammatory cytokine production. Used in control of allergic and inflammatory conditions.  [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544340/)
