# Pathophysiology

## Pathogenesis

Aortic dissection can arise from a variety of mechanisms. Most arise as a response to wall stress such as chronic systemic hypertension. These include:
1. Extracellular matrix (mucin) accumulation in intralammellar or translammelar space
2. Fragmentation and disorganisation of elastic fibers
3. Alteration of smooth muscle and nuclear loss
4. Laminar medial collapse
5. Collagen fibrosis

### Risk Factors
* Hypertension (occurs in 70% of patients with distal Standford type B AAD)
* An abrupt, transient, severe increase in blood pressure (e.g., strenuous weight lifting and use of sympathomimetic agents such as cocaine, ecstasy, or energy drinks)
* Genetic conditions including Marfan syndrome (esp. in patients < 40y.o.), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, and bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta. In patients with Marfan syndrome, cystic medial necrosis is seen in the tissues
* Pre-existing aortic aneurysm
* Atherosclerosis
* Pregnancy and delivery (risk compounded in pregnant women with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome)
* Family history
* Aortic instrumentation or surgery (coronary artery bypass, aortic or mitral valve replacement, and percutaneous stenting or catheter insertion)
* Inflammatory or infectious diseases that cause vasculitis (syphilis, cocaine use)

#### LV Hypertrophy in HTN [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5555990/)

Concentric LVH results in wall thickening due to addition of sarcomeres _in-parallel_ to existing sarcomeres. Eccentric LVH reslts in LV dilation due to _in-series_ addition of sarcomeres.

Physiologically, endurance sports such as cycling have been associated with eccentric LVH while strength sports are more associated with concentric hypertrophy and elevation in MAP. Both are associated with increased wall stress, though eccentric LVH is associated to a greater degree.
- Concentric generally associated with chronic HTN and includes pathologic increases in extracellular scaffolding 
- Eccentric more associated with volume overload

### Presentation

Rapid onset, severe tearing pain in anterior chest (ascending) and/or back (descending) is most diagnostic sign of dissection. Patients with Marfan may present with painless dissection. 

Hypertension is very common with aortic dissection, and a sudden drop in BP indicates rupture and poor outcomes. Pressure difference in 20mmHg is highly indicative of dissection as the dissection impedes blood flow to one subclavian artery via compression and/or flow alterations.

Other findings on physical include wide pulse pressure, syncope or altered mental status, loss of peripheral pulse, and horner syndrome (compression of synpathetic nerve fibers).

Patients with thoracic aortic dissection, particularly younger patients and others without an identifiable etiology for aortic dissection (eg, severe hypertension, pregnancy/delivery, aortic trauma), should be evaluated for possible underlying genetic (Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome) or familial disorders (SMAD3 mutations, familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection) known to be related. 

## Evaluation

### CXR

Key indicator of aortic dissection on CXR is widened mediastinum.

![Wide Mediastinum](/img/wide_mediastinum.jpg)

This can also present with the following conditions:
* Thoracic aortic aneurysm of the ascending and proximal descending aorta
* Aortic dissection of ascending and proximal descending aorta
* Unfolding of the aorta
* Traumatic aortic rupture
* Hilar lymphadenopathy either infectious or malignant
* Mediastinal masses like lymphoma, seminoma, thymoma
* Mediastinitis
* Cardiac tamponade
* Fractured ribs or thoracic vertebrae

Other CXR findings include L-apical cap, esophageal/tracheal deviation, L-bronchus depression, and pleural effusion.


#### CT Findings

CT can reveals intimal dissection flap, double lumen, aortic dilation and hematoma, regions of malperfusion, and contrast leak (indicates aortic rupture). CT also helps surgeon plan procedure.

![AAS CT Progression](/img/AAS_CT.jpg)

_(A,B) AAS starts with a tear in intima (arrows), when it leads to dissection of vascular media and distal reentry tears, the FL remains patent (asterisk) and is termed as classic dissection; (C,D) in absence of reentry tears, the dissecting blood may undergo complete thrombosis and form an intramural hematoma (arrows). AAS, acute aortic syndrome; FL, true lumen._ [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5949592/)

#### Echo
 - Differential doppler due to dissection flap
 - True/false lumen in ascending
 - Thrombosis

### ECG

Necessary to rule out MI. We should see normal ECG with possible tachycardia.

#### Sinus Rhythm

We need normal P wave in all 12 leads of standard ECG, i.e. P wave should be:
- always positive in lead I, lead II, and aVF
- always negative in lead aVR
- any of biphasic (-/+), positive or negative in lead aVL
- positive in all chest leads, except for V1 which may be biphasic (+/-)

### Differential
- Myocardial infarction
- Aortic aneurysm
- Cardiac tamponade (from another cause)
- Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome)
- Spontaneous pneumothorax
- Pulmonary embolism
- Stroke / transient ischemic attack

## Diagnosis

### Cardiac Physical

Excellent writeup by UCSDSM [here](https://meded.ucsd.edu/clinicalmed/heart.html)

The physical exam should include [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470557/):

* Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms
* General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress
* Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)
* Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)
* Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus
* Heart exam
* Lung exam
* Abdominal exam
* Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses


### Classifying Aortic Dissections [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441963/)
There are two main anatomic classifications used to classify aortic dissection.

The Stanford system is more frequently employed. It classifies dissections into two types based on whether ascending or descending part of the aorta involved. 

- Type A involves the ascending aorta, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear. Type A dissection is defined as a dissection proximal to the brachiocephalic artery.
- Type B aortic dissection originating distal to the left subclavian artery (last branch of aortic arch) and involving only descending aorta.

The DeBakey classification is based upon the site of origin of the dissection.
- Type 1 originates in the ascending aorta and to at least the aortic arch.
- Type 2 originates in and is limited to the ascending aorta.
- Type 3 begins in the descending aorta and extends distally above the diaphragm (type 3a) or below the diaphragm (type 3b).

Ascending aortic dissections are almost twice as common as descending dissections.

#### Consequences

Most tears take place in the ascending aorta, usually in the right lateral wall where the greatest shear force on the aorta occurs. The tear usually dissects the media in two parts, forming a lumen between intima-media and media-adventitia. An AAD can propagate anterograde and/or retrograde and depending on the direction the dissection travels, cause branch obstruction that produces ischemia of affected territory (coronary, cerebral, spinal, or visceral), and for proximal type A AADs can instigate acute tamponade, aortic regurgitation or aortic rupture.

Mortality is very high (20-30%). Other complications include 
* Multiorgan failure
* Stroke
* MI
* Paraplegia
* Renal failure
* Amputation of extremities
* Bowel ischemia
* Tamponade
* Acute aortic regurgitation
* Compression of superior vena cava

# Treatment

### Medications

Urgent cardiothoracic/vascular surgery is necessary. Analgesis and short acting beta-blocker for pain and limitation of HR/BP to limit dissection are indicated immediatley. Other BP meds such as nitroprusside can be used to further lower BP.

We use a target heart rate <60 beats per minute and target blood pressure of less than 120/80 mmHg. Patients controlled to these parameters have better outcomes with reduced rates of aortic expansion and rupture. 

### Surgery [[ref]](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-type-b-aortic-dissection#H519604286)

Type A repair involves excision of tear, obliteration of entry to false lumen, and reconstrcution with synthetic graft.

Type B management is more variable:
- For most patients who are hemodynamically stable with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, we suggest ongoing medical therapy, rather than early endovascular intervention (Grade 2C). However, the patient and clinician may reasonably choose endovascular intervention in addition to ongoing medical therapy to prevent malperfusion or other aortic complications, placing more value on potentially improved aortic outcomes in the long term over potential perioperative complications (eg, stroke, spinal cord ischemia).
- Complicated acute type B aortic dissection requires urgent intervention, which can be lifesaving. Approximately 30 percent of patients presenting with type B aortic dissection are acutely complicated. Complications can also develop during a period of initial medical management. Complicated type B aortic dissection is present if there is a major aortic branch leading to end-organ ischemia (ie, malperfusion), rapid expansion or aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic wall, expanding hematoma, impending or frank rupture, propagation of the dissection (as may be manifested by persistent or recurrent pain), or refractory hypertension (persisting despite â‰¥3 classes of antihypertensives at max doses)

## Treatment

#### Labetalol

Labetalol is often chosen as treatment of acute hypertension by anesthesia providers peri-operatively as it produces a dose-related decrease in blood pressure without reflex tachycardia without significant reduction in heart rate. Labetalol is useful as it contains both selective, competitive, alpha1-adrenergic antagonism and non-selective, competitive, beta-adrenergic (B1 and B2) blocking activity in a single agent. When analyzed in the laboratory, the activity ratio of alpha to beta-blockade has been estimated to be approximately 1 to 3 and 1 to 7 following oral and intravenous (IV) administration, respectively.

Managing hypertension, or high blood pressure, typically involves a combination of medical treatment and lifestyle changes. It's essential to work closely with a healthcare professional to create a personalized plan that suits your specific needs. Here's a comprehensive guide on managing hypertension both medically and through lifestyle changes:

### HTN Management

**Medications:** Combination antihypertensives include combined agents from the following pharmacologic classes: diuretics and potassium-sparing diuretics, beta blockers and diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics, angiotensin-II antagonists and diuretics, and calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors.

![HTN Combo Treatments](/img/HTN_med_combos.png)

**Lifestyle Management:**
1. **Dietary Changes:**
   - **Reduce Sodium (Salt) Intake:** Aim to consume less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day (about one teaspoon of salt). Reducing sodium can help lower blood pressure.
   - **DASH Diet:** Consider following the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products.
   - **Limit Alcohol:** If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For most adults, this means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.
2. **Exercise:**
   - **Regular Physical Activity:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.
3. **Weight Management:**
   - **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Losing even a modest amount of weight can help lower blood pressure. Consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian for guidance on a weight loss plan.
4. **Stress Management:**
   - **Practice Stress-Reduction Techniques:** Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce stress, which can contribute to elevated blood pressure.
5. **Limit Caffeine:** Some individuals are sensitive to caffeine, which can temporarily raise blood pressure. Limit your caffeine intake if you notice this effect.
6. **Smoking Cessation:** If you smoke, quitting is essential. Smoking raises blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease.
7. **Regular Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Poor sleep can contribute to elevated blood pressure.

## Social Determinants

Those who tend to trust medical systems and anticipate fair treatment are predominantly male, non-disabled, white, and identify as straight. Women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are far more likely to distrust their healthcare providersâ€“and the healthcare system as a whole.

In the U.S., 77% of people with disabilities, 69% of people from ethnic minority groups, and 70% of people from the LGBTQ+ community say they have had experiences that damaged their trust in the healthcare system.

The survey also showed the compounding effect of marginalization: People who fell into more than one of these groups were significantly more likely to have had a bad experience while seeking care. For example, in the U.S., 80% of people who have disabilities and identify as LGBTQ+ reported losing trust in the healthcare system due to their personal experience, compared with 56% of people without those backgrounds.
