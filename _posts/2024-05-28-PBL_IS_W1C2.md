## MRSA

Staphylococcus aureus is a **Gram-positive, nonmotile, coagulase-positive coccoid** bacterium. Methicillin-resistant S. Aureus was first described in 1961. Today, the name is a bit misleading as methicillin is not used due to toxicity and has been replaced by penicillins such as _oxacillin, flucloxacillin, and dicloxacillin_. [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201833).

### Mechanism of resistasnce

Resistance is usually conferred by the acquisition of a nonnative gene encoding a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a), with significantly lower affinity for β-lactams. This resistance allows cell-wall biosynthesis, the target of β-lactams, to continue even in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. PBP2a is encoded by the mecA gene, which is carried on a distinct mobile genetic element (SCCmec), the expression of which is controlled through a proteolytic signal transduction pathway comprising a sensor protein (MecR1) and a repressor (MecI) [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26034890/).

### Epidemiology

In the United States, ∼53% of S. aureus clinical isolates were methicillin-resistant in 2005. MRSA has also been identified as the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) presenting to US hospital emergency departments, which is largely attributed to the emergence of CA-MRSA.

MRSA is often sub-categorized by epidemiological patterns
- **HA-MRSA**: Healthcare associated. Cause of bacteraemia, pneumonia and, less commonly, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Residency in a nursing home, antibiotic exposure (particularly to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, leading to antibiotic selection pressure), surgery, haemodialysis, chronic wounds or indwelling invasive devices have an increased risk of infection with HA-MRSA
- **CA-MRSA**: Community associated. The most common clinical presentation for CA-MRSA is SSTI, which is often associated with abscesses or pus formation and accounts for ∼90% of cases. Individuals with CA-MRSA infection usually lack the traditional risk factors associated with HA-MRSA strains. Populations or settings in which outbreaks of CA-MRSA infection have been reported include sports teams, military personnel and prison. 
- **LA-MRSA**: Livestock associated. LA-MRSA has been associated with localized infections, such as SSTIs (including abscesses and wound infections) and otitis, as well as severe and invasive infections, such as bacteraemia, pneumonia, osteoarticular infections and endocarditis.

### Pathophysiology

Colonization typically precedes the development of infection. The principal site of S. aureus colonization is the nose, although colonization at other sites occurs, notably in the throat and perineum.

During S. aureus colonization, initial bacterial adherence to the host's epithelial cells is mediated by teichoic acid on the cell wall, whereas microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules play a part at a later stage of nasal colonization. Clumpling factor B is especially important for nasal colonization. 

#### Virulence factors

MRSA expressive an extensive array of virulence factors including:
- Fibronectin and collagen binding proteins/adhesins
- Exracellular adherance proteins targeting ICAM1
- Staphylokinase (cleaving plasmin to plasminogen)
- Various complement inhibitors targeted at C3, C3b, C3bBb, C5a and factor H
- IgG and IgGamma receptor inhibitors
- Catalase and other enzymes which neutralize ROS, NETs, defensins, etc.
- Toxins including alpha toxin, delta toxin (and other pore -forming toxins), beta-hemolysin, exfoliative toxin, enterotoxins, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1.

### Clinical Presentation

MRSA can cause a wide range of infections, such as SSTIs, pneumonia, osteoarticular infections, toxic shock syndrome (a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of infection with certain types of bacteria, including S. aureus, caused by the release of bacterial toxins and presenting with clinical features that can include fever, rash and hypotension) and bacteraemia, which may be complicated by endocarditis or severe sepsis. See epidemiology section for typical presentation of HA, CA, and LA-MRSA.

### Diagnosis and treatment

MRSA is isolated by culturing on Muller-Hinton agar and then applying a cefoxitin disk. There is also a bacteriophage-based assay for rapid detection of MRSA. PCR is also available. 

#### Antibiotic treatment

Vancomycin has been the drug of choice for MRSA for many years. However, resistance has arisen in several strains due to transference of the _vanA_ gene. These strains are primarily found in diabetic foot wounds coinfected with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

**Skin Infections**: Patients with cellulitis should be managed with antibiotic therapy. A critical part of treatment is source control. Patients with an abscess should undergo incision and drainage, and debrided material should be sent for culture and susceptibility testing.

Patients with mild infection (localized involvement with no systemic symptoms) due to known or suspected MRSA may be treated with oral antibiotic therapy. Preferred agents are TMP-SMX, Clindamycin, Doxy, or Minocycline. This can be continued for 5-14 days.

Patients with any of: extensive tissue involvement, systemic toxicity, rapid progression, persistence after 48-72hr of oral therapy, immunocompromise, or infection proximal to indwelling device should be treated with **parental antibiotics**. Agents of choice are IV vancomycin or daptomycin. This can be continued for 5-14 days.

**MRSA Bacteremia**: IV vancomycin or daptomycin (and more recently ceftobiprole) are first line for initial treatment. Patients who do not respond should be switched to daptomycin (unless they have pneumonia).

## Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the progressive breakdown of articular cartilage, subchondral bone remodeling, and the formation of osteophytes (bony spurs). In the hip joint, OA can lead to significant pain, stiffness, and functional impairment.

### Total Hip Arthroplasty

Total hip arthroplasty (THA), commonly known as hip replacement surgery, is a highly effective treatment option for advanced hip OA when conservative measures fail to provide adequate relief. The procedure involves the surgical removal of the damaged hip joint and replacement with an artificial prosthetic implant.
During THA, the following steps are typically performed:

* Approach and exposure: The surgeon makes an incision to access the hip joint, either through a posterior (from the back) or an anterior (from the front) approach.
* Femoral head removal: The femoral head (the ball-shaped portion of the thigh bone) is dislocated and removed.
* Acetabular preparation: The damaged acetabulum (hip socket) is prepared by removing any remaining cartilage and achieving a smooth, bleeding surface.
* Implant placement: The acetabular component (cup) is positioned and secured in the prepared acetabulum, often using bone cement or press-fit techniques. The femoral component (stem) is then inserted into the prepared femoral canal.
* Joint reduction: The femoral head component (ball) is attached to the femoral stem, and the new ball-and-socket joint is reduced (joined together).
* Closure: The surgical site is closed in layers, and appropriate dressings are applied.

### Prosthetic Joint Infection

Only a minimal microbial burden is required to initiate a PJI - etiologic organisms can adhere to the surfaces of arthroplasty components and form biofilms. Biofilms notoriously exhibit a marked resistance to a wide array of antimicrobial agents and are adept at avoiding innate immune defenses. The offending microorganisms in PJI typically originate from the skin microbiome and may be introduced during the perioperative phase of the implantation procedure Alternatively, these pathogens can seed the implant postoperatively via hematogenous dissemination or direct inoculation from adjacent infected tissues [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448131/).

The predominant clinical manifestation of PJI is pain within the affected joint.Local inflammatory signs, including erythema, joint swelling, and warmth, may be evident in some patients; systemic manifestations of infection, such as fever, are frequently absent.

Risk factors include: tobacco use, excessive alcohol, poor oral hygiene, malnutrition, IV drug use, poor glycemic control, obesity, preceeding intra-articular injections, immunosupression, poorly controlled DM, CKD, HIV, extended surgical time, and postoperative wound dehiscence. **Cefazolin**, a first generation cephalosporin, is the preoperative antibiotic of choice in the US. 

### Other management options

While THA is a highly effective treatment for advanced hip OA, various non-surgical management options may be considered for patients with milder disease or those who are not candidates for surgery:

1. Weight loss: Reducing weight can significantly decrease the load on the affected joint and alleviate symptoms.
2. Physical therapy: Exercise programs, including strengthening and range-of-motion exercises, can help improve function and reduce pain.
3. Assistive devices: The use of canes, walkers, or other assistive devices can help redistribute weight and reduce joint stress.
4. Medications: Analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) and intra-articular injections (e.g., corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid) can provide symptomatic relief.
5. Complementary therapies: Modalities such as heat/cold therapy, massage, and acupuncture may be used as adjunctive treatments.
6. Arthroscopic procedures: In select cases, arthroscopic procedures (e.g., debridement, osteoplasty) may be considered for symptomatic relief.

## Antibiotic Resistance [[ref]](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.vmbf-0016-2015)

Resistance is developed via 4 primary mechanisms:
- **i) modifications of the antimicrobial molecule**: enzymatic modification of drugs can confer resistance to aminoglycosides, shloramphenicol, and streptogramins. Enzymatic destruciton (via β-lactamases) is the main mechanism of **β-lactam** resistance. 
    - _Providencia stuartii_, _Enterococcus faecium_, and _Serratia marcesens_ are notable for their aminoglycoside acetyltransferases.
    - There are many classes of β-lactamases, the most dangerous being carbapenemases. They are typically serine based, but some are zinc based.
- ii) prevention of the compound reaching the antibiotic target
    - **Decreased penetration**: the outer membrane of Gram (-) organisms provides a powerful barrier against many hydrophilic molecules such as β-lactams, tetracyclines, glycopeptides, and fluroquinolones. Downregulation or differential porin expression is a primary mechanism of resistance
    - **Actively efflux**: pumps affect a variety of classes including protein synthesis inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, carbapenems, and polymyxins. A classic example is the Tet efflux pump for tetracylcines (usually found in gram negative bacteria)
- **iii) Change in target site**: target protection proteins such as Tet(M) and Tet(O) dislodge the antibiotic (in this case tetracyclines) from their arget site (the ribosome), or reducing antibiotic-target interaction (in the case of quinolones). Modifications to the target site via point mutation, enzymatic alteration, or replacement/bypass of teh original target are employed resistance to rifampin, fluroquinolones, erythromycin, penecillins, and oxazolidinoes. 
    - **PBP2a** acquisition via mecA in MRSA is an example of complete bypass. A similar mechanism is used in TMP-SMX resistance, where plasmids confer additional mechanisms for the production of THF. Finally, D-ala-D-ala conversion to D-ala-D-lactate in E. faecium with one of several _van_ gene clusters confers vancomycin resistance.
- **iv) Resistance due to global cell-adaptive processes**: the most relevant clincal examples of global adaptation are daptomycin and vancomycin resistance in _S. aureus_. The precise mechanism is though to involve changes in the membrane charge and modification in phospholipid related enzymes. Many subtle metabolic changes have been observed in resistant populations, however.

### Preventing Resistance

Common strategies of antiiotic stewardship programs include:
* Restrictions and preauthorization 
* Prospective audit with intervention and feedback
* Clinical education 
* Formulary optimization 
* Optimization of dosing and administration 
* Deescalation (after 48-72 hours) 
* Elimination of redundant combination therapy 
* Early switch from intravenous to oral administration
* Appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy  
* Penicillin desensitization 

![ABX steward](/img/abx_steward.png)

Utilization is tracted via the metrics:
- **Defined Daily Dosing (DDD)**: total grams of **_each_** antibiotic used daily divided by the WHO-assigned DDD
- **Days of Therapy (DOT)**: Sum of days patient is on each antimicrobial agent
- **Length of Therapy (LOT)** Total days patient is on any antimicrobial therapy
- **Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR)**: metric to compare observed-to-predicted DOT to provide a benchmark for national comparison

## Case medications
* **Chlorhexidine**: chlorhexidine’s broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects are due to its ability to disrupt microbial cell membranes. The positively charged chlorhexidine molecule reacts with negatively charged phosphate groups on microbial cell surfaces - this reaction both destroys the integrity of the cell, allowing leakage of intracellular material, and allows chlorhexidine to enter the cell, causing precipitation of cytoplasmic components and ultimately cell death.
* **Mupirocin**: mupirocin specifically and reversibly binds to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA (tRNA) synthetase, which is an enzyme that promotes the conversion of isoleucine and tRNA to isoleucyl-tRNA. Inhibition of this enzyme subsequently leads to the inhibition of the bacterial protein and RNA synthesis
* **Vancomycin**: vancomycin prevents incorporation of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)- and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-peptide subunits from being incorporated into the peptidoglycan matrix, which forms the **major structural component of Gram-positive cell walls**. Vancomycin forms hydrogen bonds with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides, preventing the incorporation of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits into the peptidoglycan matrix. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics. Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi.
* **TMP/SMX**: 
Trimethoprim is a reversible inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, one of the principal enzymes catalyzing the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) from dihydrofolic acid (DHF). Tetrahydrofolic acid is necessary for the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins and ultimately for continued bacterial survival - inhibiting its synthesis, then, results in bactericidal activity. Trimethoprim binds with a much stronger affinity to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase as compared to its mammalian counterpart, allowing trimethoprim to selectively interfere with bacterial biosynthetic processes. Trimethoprim is often given in combination with sulfamethoxazole (a **sulfonamide**), which inhibits the preceding step in bacterial protein synthesis - given together, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim inhibit two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins. As a monotherapy trimethoprim is considered bacteriostatic, but in combination with sulfamethoxazole is thought to exert bactericidal activity.
