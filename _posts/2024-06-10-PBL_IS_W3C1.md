## Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

[Main Source: Pai et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201676)

### Epidemiology

For a detailed report of epidemiology see the [WHO report (Figs. 14, 18, 19)](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/373828/9789240083851-eng.pdf?sequence=1)

### Risk Factors

Among major known risk factors for TB, HIV infection is the strongest; 12% of all new active TB disease cases and 25% of all TB-related deaths occur in HIV-positive individuals. The majority (75%) of HIV-associated active TB disease cases and deaths occur in Africa. Active TB disease was the leading cause of hospitalization among HIV-infected adults (18%) and children (10%).

Nonetheless, other risk factors are responsible for the majority of infections. These include:
1. Undernutrition
2. Indoor air pollution
3. Diabetes Melligus (3x Risk)
4. Excess alcohol use (3x Risk)
5. Smoking (2x risk)

### Microbiology

The majority of TB cases are attributed to M. tuberculosis (sensu stricto) or the closely related organism Mycobacterium africanum; a minority of cases are due to zoonotic members of the M. tuberculosis complex, such as Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium caprae.

M. tuberculosis has a waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, M. tuberculosis can appear weakly Gram-positive. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope. The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. The slow division time (18-24hr) makes M. tuberculosis difficult to grow in lab, requiring special media such as Lowenstein-Jensen agar. It can survive in a dry state for weeks.

The primary difference between virulent strains and M. bovis (the basis of the BCG vaccine) is the Region of difference 1 (RD1) which contains genes encoding ESX01 secretion system along with other virulence factors.

### Presentation

TB is very insidious in onset and most people will not progress to an active infecion after initial infection. 5-15%, however, do get active TB in the first few months to few years after contracting the illness. Those who do not immediatley progress may eliminate the disease (in which case TST/IGRA may be negative) or more commonly, remain in a latent stage (LTBI).

![TB lifecycle](/img/Tuberculosis_life.webp)

TB enters via the repiratory tract where it encounters alveolar macrophages in the lower airway. The macrophages internalize the bacteria and then TB blocks phagosome fusion via sulfatides and stimulate TNF-alpha release via cord factor, attracting more macrophages.

Eventually, the bacteria accesses the parenchyma leading to recruitment of a host of immune cells that form a granuloma to contain the bacteria. 

### Clinical Manifestations [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK344404/)

Once TB becomes active, there are a variety of possible presentations.

- **Primary TB**: Primary infection remains undiagnosed in the majority of cases, as symptoms are mild, non-specific and usually self-resolving. A primary (Ghon) complex is formed, consisting of a granuloma, typically in the middle or lower zones of the lung (primary or Ghon focus) in combination with transient hilar and/or paratracheal lymphadenopathy and some overlying pleural reaction. The primary complex usually resolves within weeks or months, leaving signs of fibrosis and calcification detectable on chest X-ray. In general the risk of disease progression following primary infection is low, but young children and immunocompromised patients are at increased risk.
- **Pulmonary TB**: Onset of pulmonary TB typically occurs over weeks or months. The typical triad of fever, nightsweats and weightloss are present in roughly 75, 45 and 55 % of patients respectively, while a persistent non-remitting cough is the most frequently reported symptom (95 %)
    - Parynchemal disease with cavitary lesions include productive or non0productive cough. Massive hemoptysis is possible at late stages. 
    - Endobronchial TB has similar symptoms to parynchemal disease and may progress to stricutre.
    - Intra-thoracic lymphatic diseaes: Enlarged peri-hilar and/or paratracheal lymph nodes may obstruct large airways with resultant collapse or hyperinflation of distal lung segments, form cold abscesses with persistent high fever, or erode into surrounding anatomical structures such as the pericardium leading to TB pericarditis. Peri-hilar and/or paratracheal lymph node enlargement with/without airway compression is the cardinal sign of intra-thoracic lymph node disease.

#### Extrapulmonary TB
- **Pleural**: Typical presentation is acute with fever, cough and localized pleuritic chest pain.Pleural effusion is mostly lymphocytic with high protein.
- **Miliary TB**: Clinical symptoms are mostly constitutional, including malaise, fever, weightloss, sweats, anorexia. Pulmonary signs may be similar but often less pronounced than in uncomplicated pulmonary TB. If the brain is involved, neurological symptoms may include headache, reduced consciousness and cranial nerve palsies. Involvement of other organs usually does not elicit localized symptoms. In immunocompromised patients physical signs may be less apparent and include dyspnoea, wasting, lymphnode enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, cutaneous lesions. These patients are more at risk of meningeal involvement. Potentially disasterous complications include **ARDS, penumothorax, and multi-organ failure**.
- **Cervical Lymphadenitis**: aka **_scrofula_**. Caused by both TB and NTM. The patient usually presents with a palpable (lymph node) mass greater than 2 × 2 cm and mostly in the cervical area (60 %), either in the jugular, posterior triangle or supraclavicular region, with or without fistula or sinus formation. Other complications include cold, non-tender abscess. Diagnosis is classically confirmed by excisional biopsy and histological and microbiological examination.

- **CNS TB**: The most common clinical manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) TB is tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Other entities are CNS tuberculoma, which may be present without symptoms or rarely with seizures, tuberculous encephalopathy (rare, only described in children) and tuberculous radiculomyelitis. Pathogenesis is thought to be through a two-step process, in which heamotogenous spread leads to a tuberculous focus (Rich focus) in the brain, which then invades and release bacilli in the subarachnoid space. It is the most lethal form of disease and often is the cause of death in miliary TB. In the more advanced stages patients become more confused, present with reduced consciousness, hemiplegia, paraplegia and urinary retention (seen with spinal involvement) and cerebral nerve palsies, most frequently involved is nerve VI (up to 40 % of cases), but also III and VII. Seizures are not frequently a presenting symptom in adults (seen in less than 5 % of cases), however often reported in children (50 % of TBM cases). PCR is the diagnostic of choice due to the need for rapid treatment. 
- **Other presentations**: pericarditis, spinal tuberculosis (with accompanying kyphosis a-la **Pott's Disease** leading to massive compressionand increased risk for CNS TB),arthritis, urogential, and laryngeal TB are also possible.

### Diagnosis and Differential

LTBI can be identified with TST, T-spot, IGRA, microscopy, and PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) [[ref]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/19/5826).

#### TST

The TST, performed using the Mantoux technique, consists of an intradermal injection of 5 tuberculin units (5 TU) of purified protein derivative (PPD) S or 2 TU of PPD RT23. In a person who has cell-mediated immunity to these antigens, a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction will occur within 48–72 hours. Interpretation of the TST takes into account the size of induration (NOT THE SIZE OF SURROUNDING ERYTHEMA), the pre-test probability of M. tuberculosis infection and the risk of developing active TB disease if the person was truly infected. 

TST is **positive** in the following situations:
- 5-10mm:
    - HIV/AIDS
    - Recent TB contact
    - Firbotic CXR
    - SOT
    - Otherwise immunosupressed
- 10-15mm:
    - Recent immigrants from endemic countries
    - IV drug use
    - High-risk settings
    - Lab personell
    - Children < 4y.o.
- 15+mm:
    - Persons with no other risk factors

#### IGRA (QuantiFERON-gold)

The QFT-G is an indirect test for M. tuberculosis infection that is based on measurement of a cell-mediatedimmune response. A cocktail of 3 mycobacterial proteins (26 ESAT-6, 27 CFP10, and TB 7,7) stimulate the patient's T-cells in vitroto release interferon-gamma, which is then measured using ELISA technology. The test detects infections produced by the M. tuberculosis complex (including M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. africanum infections). BCG strains and the majority of other non-tuberculosis mycobacteria do not harbor ESAT-6, CFP10, and TB 7,7 proteins,thus, patients either vaccinated with BCG or infected with most environmental mycobacteria should test negative.

#### T-Spot

IFN-gamma is captured via an ELISA based method to cause spots to appear on various plates.

![T-spot](/img/Tspot.png)

The spots are interpreted by subtracting spot count in NIL from the ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Postive result is greater than 8 net spots. 5-7 spot results should be re-run. Test is invalid if mitogen does not show more spots than ESAT-6/CFP-10.

#### Other test characteristics

![Test Characteristics](/img/other_TB_Tests.png)

#### Imaging

CXR and PET-CT are the primary imaging modalities for TB. PET-CT is too expensive for routine use, however. 

### Treatment

80% of strains are fully succeptible. 13% are mono-isoniazid resistant and the rest are MDR-TB strains. 

#### LTBI 

LTBI should only be screened in risk groups such as HIV patients, those with contact with confirmed TB, those initiating anti-TNF immunosupression, those on dialysis, about to undergo SOT/bone marrow transplant, or with silicosis. CDC reccomendations include:
- 3 months once weekly isoniazid+rifapentine
- 4 months daily rifampin
- 3 months dailty isoniazid + rifampin

These shorter regimens have higher completion rates and lower hepatotoxicity. [[ref]](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm)

#### Active TB

There are various regimens for drug sensitive TB, varing in the dosing during intensive and continuation phases. All of these include Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol (RIPE):

![RIPE](/img/RIPE.png)

The common adverse events are mild increases in the level of liver enzymes, skin rash, gastrointestinal intolerance, neuropathy and arthralgia and can be managed symptomatically without discontinuation of the offending drugs. Serious adverse events are severe hepatitis, immune thrombocytopaenia, agranulocytosis, haemolysis, renal failure, optic neuritis and ototoxicity. The most common adherence monitoring approach is **Directly observed therapy**. 

Drug resistant TB requires modifications. First line additions include **fluoroquinolones**. Second line injectable agents are **aminoglycosides** such as kanamycin, amikacin, and streptomycin (though streptomycin resistance is on the rise) along with 2 core oral agents from the **thioamide** and **oxazolidinone** classes.

### Prophylaxis and Precautions

Globally, >90% of all newbords are vaccinated with BCG. The vaccine is not particularly effective, however, and only prevents severe extrapulmonary disease in 50-80% of cases.

Treatment during the window period has been recommended for susceptible and vulnerable contacts to prevent rapidly emerging tuberculosis disease. This treatment should follow that of latent TB.

#### Drug resistance

TB develops resistance via genetic mutation - primarily via target mutation (e.g. mutant RNA polymerase to avoid rifampin) or defective enzymes (catalsase unable to activate isoniazid).

XDR-TB, an abbreviation for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), is a form of TB that is caused by a strain of M. tuberculosis complex that is resistant to rifampicin (and may also be resistant to isoniazid), and that is also resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and to at least one other Group A drug (bedaquiline or linezolid).

### Reporting Requirements

All active TB infections are required to be reported at a state and federal level (to the CDC). Latent TB is also required to be reported in several states, including Texas.

## Common infections in Immigrants

Refugees and asylum seekers may hold a higher burden of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138615/). All refugees should be screened for these infections upon arrival. 

### EMTALA

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) guarantees access to emergency medical services regardless of ability to pay. All individuals must be screened by qualified medical personell to determine if the medical condition is an emergency. If it is not, they can be discharged. Otherwise, they must be stabilized and discharged or transfered to an appropriate treatment center. 

No delay for screening or treatment is allowed. Transfers must only be initiated when medical risks have been mitigated and the reciving facility has the capability to treat the patient.

Emergency medical conditions can include reproductive healthrelated conditions. In circumstances in which the appropriate stabilizing treatment is care that could fall under a definition of abortion, the hospital is required to offer that stabilizing treatment irrespective of any directly conflicting state laws. However, in Texas, the US Department of health and human services (HHS) is barred from enforcing the interpretation that EMTALA overrides Texas abortion laws due to the preliminary injunction in Texas v. Becerra, No. 5:22-CV-185-H.
