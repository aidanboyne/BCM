# Lymphomas

## Hodgkin's Lymphomas

Hodgkin's lymphoma is characterized by Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells which appear as giant tumor cells in the lymph nodes with a distinctive bilobed "owl-eyes" nucleus. Immunohistochemistry stains for RS cells are positive for CD30 and CD15 but typically negative for CD20 and CD45, which are positive only in neoplastic NLP-HL cells. In addition to CD15 and CD30, RS cells are usually positive for PAX5, CD25, HLA-DR, ICAM-1, Fascin, CD95 (apo-1/fas), TRAF1, CD40, and CD86.

Four features characterize Hodgkin lymphomas. They commonly arise in the cervical lymph nodes; the disease is more common in young adults; there are scattered large mononuclear Hodgkin and multinucleated cells (Reed-Sternberg) intermixed in a background of a mixture of non-neoplastic inflammatory cells; finally, T lymphocytes are often observed surrounding the characteristic neoplastic cells. Hodgkin lymphoma has an excellent overall prognosis with approximately an 80% cure rate. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499969/)

Other pathological findings include lacunar cells (multilobated nuclei with abundant pale cytoplam in an empty space) and mummified cells (neoplastic cells with condensed cytoplasm and pyknotic reddish nuclei and smudged chromatin) as shown below.

### Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 

**Nodular Sclerosis**: Accounts for 70 percent of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cases
- Most common type in young adults  
- Involved lymph nodes contain elements of fibrous tissues (sclerosis)
- Incidence similar in males and females
- Highly curable
- B symptoms in approximately 40 percent of cases

**Mixed Cellularity**: Accounts for 20-25 percent of cHL cases
- More prevalent in children, older adults and patients with HIV infection
- Most common in males
- Involved lymph nodes contain Reed-Sternberg cells and several other cell types
- B symptoms common
- Associated with EBV infection 
- May present with eosinophilia

**Lymphocyte-rich**: Accounts for about 5 percent of cHL cases
- Involved lymph nodes contain numerous normal-appearing lymphocytes and Reed-Sternberg cells
- Usually diagnosed at an early stage
- More common in males
- B symptoms are rare
- Best prognosis

**Lymphocyte-depleted**: Rarest cHL subtype 
- Involved lymph nodes contain few normal lymphocytes but numerous RS cells 
- More prevalent in older adults and patients with HIV infection 
- Usually diagnosed at an advanced stage 
- B symptoms common
- Associated with EBV infection 
- Worst prognosis

#### Presentation

Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma generally progresses slowly. Typical presentation is asymptomatic lymphadenopathy or chest mass on radiograph. "B symptoms"- fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss - are present about 40% of the time overall. Most common sites of lymphadenopathy are the cervical/supraclavicular lymph nodes. May also be present in axillary, inginal, and mediastinal nodes. The cancer disseminates from a single node to adjacent nodes via lymphatic channels. Non-contiguous spread is suggestive of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Other symptoms include itchyness, hypercalcemia, anemia, and eosinophilia. 

### Diagnosis

First tests in a suspected case of HL are CBC with ESR. ESR may be elevated due to high levels of inflammatory molecules produced by the neoplasms. Diagnosis requires histological evidence as infectious, autoimmune, and other inflammatory processes can cause lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, fever, and other systemic symptoms that can be difficult to distinguish from cHL. Reactive processes have a polymorphous infiltrate that resembles cHL, but they lack diagnostic Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells. An excisional biopsy or multiple core biopsies is required to confirm the diagnosis of cHL and distinguish it from reactive causes of lymphadenopathy.

#### Cytogenetics

A number of nonrandom changes, including several that are also common in other malignancies including the non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, are frequently present, e.g., deletions of 1p, 6q, and 7q. Deletions of 4q, with loss of 4q25→q27, that have also been reported may show some specificity for Hodgkin’s disease. [[ref]](https://karger.com/cgr/article-abstract/80/1-4/23/339967/Cytogenetics-of-Hodgkin-s-disease)


### Monitoring post remission

Immediatley after treatment is completed, PET/CT is ideal to detect residual active tumor activity. Negative scans have shown relapse exclusion rate with 80-90% accuracy, but it may not be able to detect microscopic disease. Postive scans may not necessarily relapse (up to 40%). 

After treatment, patients can be categorized as:
- **Complete remission:** No evidence of disease or symptoms. Masses are OK in HL as long as there is no FDG activity on PET scan. If bone marrow was involved, a biopsy of involved site must also be negative
- **Partial remission**: at least 50% decrease in sum of produces of largest measureable lesions. PET positive in at least one site
- **Stable disease**

### Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma

Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) affects about 5 percent of Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The following are some characteristics of NLPHL:
* Most common in 30 to 50 year-old age group
* More common in males
* Slow growing and can relapse many years later
* Highly curable
* Small risk of transformation to aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7 percent of cases)

## Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas

![Non-H](/img/non-hodgkin.pn.PNG)

#### Mature B-cell lymphomas (about 85%-90% of NHL cases)
**Aggressive**
Aggressive or highly aggressive lymphomas commonly present subacutely or acutely with a rapidly growing mass; constitutional symptoms of fever, night sweats, or weight loss; and/or tumor lysis syndrome. The agressive lymphomas include:

* Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (30%)
* Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (3%)—has features of both indolent and aggressive NHL
* Lymphoblastic lymphoma (2%)
* Burkitt lymphoma (BL) (2%)

* Transformed follicular and transformed mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas
* High-grade B-cell lymphoma with double or triple hits (HBL)
* Primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type
* Primary DLBCL of the central nervous system
* Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma
* Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated lymphoma

**Indolent**
Indolent lymphomas are often insidious, presenting with slowly growing or waxing and waning lymphadenopathy over months or years, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and/or cytopenias. The indolent lymphomas include:

* Follicular lymphoma (FL) (22%)
* Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (7%)
* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small-cell lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (7%)
* Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (8%)

* Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) (1%)
* Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)

[[ref]](https://www.lls.org/lymphoma/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/nhl-subtypes)

#### Mature T-cell and NK Cell Lymphomas (about 10%-15% of NHL cases)
**Systemic**
* Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) (6%)
* Systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) (2%)
* Lymphoblastic lymphoma (2%)
* Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma
* Enteropathy-associated intestinal T-cell lymphoma
* Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma
* Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL)

* Sézary syndrome (SS)
* Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (pcALCL)
* Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL)
* Primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma

### Diagnosis

Other than the nodal and B-symptoms mentioned above, extranodal symptoms include GI upset and vomiting, early satiety, headache, focal neurologic syndromes, rash, cutaneous plaques, and skin ulcers. Abnormal lab values include cytopenias and lymphocytosis, hypercalcemia (especially in HTLV-1 associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma), hyperuricemia in particularly agressive cancers, elevated LDH, and abnormal SEP (especially in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and other B-cell NHLs)

#### Cytogenetics

Characteristic chromosomal translocations are found to be associated with subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), for example t(8;14)(q24;q32) and Burkitt lymphoma, t(14;18)(q32;q21) and follicular lymphoma, and t(11;14)(q13;q32) in mantle cell lymphoma. Only few recurrent cytogenetic aberrations have been identified in the T-cell NHL and the best known is the ALK gene translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

### Biopsy

AAccording to expert guidelines, lymph node surgical excision is the standard of care for lymphoma diagnosis. However, core needle biopsy (CNB) has become widely accepted as part of the lymphoma diagnostic workup over the past decades. Although CNB provided a definitive diagnosis in 92.3% and seemed to be a reliable method of investigation for most patients with suspected lymphoma, it remained less conclusive than surgical excision, which provided a definitive diagnosis in 98.1%. [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/140/24/2573/485815/Lymph-node-excisions-provide-more-precise-lymphoma?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

### Ann Arbor staging system

The Ann Arbor staging system was the landmark lymphoma staging classification system for both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is named after the town of Ann Arbor in the US state of Michigan where the Committee on Hodgkin's Disease Staging Classification met in 1971 to agree on it. It updated and replaced the earlier Rye staging system 2. The classification has since been updated and modified, with the currently used criteria being the Lugano classification and the LYRIC classification.

Staging system
* stage I: involvement of a single lymph node region or of a single extralymphatic organ or site
* stage II: involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm or localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site 
* stage III: involvement of lymph node regions or structures on both sides of the diaphragm
* stage IV: diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, or either: 
    * isolated extralymphatic organ involvement without adjacent regional lymph node involvement, but with disease in distant sites
    * involvement of the liver, bone marrow, pleura or cerebrospinal fluid

Additional substaging variables include:
* A: asymptomatic
* B: presence of B symptoms (including fever, night sweats and weight loss of ≥10% of body weight over 6 months)
* E: involvement of a single, extranodal site, contiguous or proximal to a known nodal site (stages I to III only; additional extranodal involvement is stage IV)
* S: splenic involvement
* X: bulky nodal disease: nodal mass >1/3 of intrathoracic diameter or 10 cm in dimension


### PET CT

Positron emission tomography uses tracers which emit positrons to localize areas of high metabolic activity in 3-D space. Tracers used commonly include fluorine-18 (18F) fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG), called FDG PET. 18F-FDG is glucose analog taken up by the cells and trapped via hexokinase activity, which is raised in cancers that are rapidly growing. When combined with CT, PET/CT allows physicians to identify the anatomic location of likley tumors and metastises. PET/CT is used extensivley in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning of Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer.


# Treatment

## ABVD Chemo Regimen
- **Doxyrubicin**:  Doxorubicin is part of the anthracycline group of chemotherapeutic agents. Generally, doxorubicin is thought to exert its antineoplastic activity through 2 primary mechanisms: intercalation into DNA and disrupt topoisomerase-mediated II repairs and free radical-mediated cellular damage when combined with iron
    - Adverse reactions are common after doxorubicin administration, including fatigue, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and oral sores. Bone marrow suppression and an increased risk of secondary malignancy diagnoses may occur. Doxorubicin extravasation during intravenous administration can result in severe tissue ulceration and necrosis, which worsens over time. Doxorubicin is also associated with significant cardiac toxicity, which limits the long-term use of the drug. The mechanism of action of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity differs from the drug’s antitumor mechanism. It involves increased oxidative stress, down-regulation of cardiac-specific genes, and induction of cardiac myocyte apoptosis by doxorubicin. The acute cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin occurs within days of the drug’s administration and occurs in approximately 11% of patients who receive the drug. Doxorubicin-induced irreversible cardiomyopathy occurs within a few months of the end of treatment but has also been reported to occur up to twenty years after treatment termination. Doxorubicin-induced heart failure has a 1-year survival rate of about 50%. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/)
- **Bleomycin**: Bleomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with a unique mechanism of antitumor activity. The drug binds to guanosine-cytosine-rich portions of DNA via association of the "S" tripeptide and by partial intercalation of the bithiazole rings. A group of five nitrogen atoms arranged in a square-pyramidal conformation binds divalent metals including iron, the active ligand, and copper, an inactive ligand. Molecular oxygen, bound by the iron, can produce highly reactive free radicals and Fe(III). The free radicals produce DNA single-strand breaks at 3'-4' bonds in deoxyribose. This yields free base propenals, especially of thymine: cytotoxicity is cell-cycle-phase specific for G2 phase. In humans, bleomycin is rapidly eliminated primarily by renal excretion. This accounts for approximately half of a dose. In patients with renal compromise or extensive prior cisplatin therapy, the drug half-life can extend from 2 to 4 hours up to 21 hours. Thus, dose adjustments are needed when creatinine clearance is less than or equal to 3N mL/min. [[ref]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1384141/)
    - Bleomycin has since received a wide array of FDA-approved therapeutic indications, including germinal cell tumors, gestational trophoblastic disease, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-FDA-approved indications include AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma, and advanced stages of mycosis fungoides.
    - The most common serious adverse effect of bleomycin is pulmonary toxicity, often referred to as bleomycin pulmonary toxicity or BPT. This adverse effect sometimes leads to pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and irreversible disease with a poor prognosis. Less serious reactions include skin pigmentation changes, itching, hypogeusia, rash, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555895/)
- **Vinblastine**: belongs to the category of vinca alkaloids, a class of drugs that function by impeding the proper division of cancer cells. This drug inhibits cell growth by disrupting mitosis by interfering with microtubule polymerization. Other effects include inhibition of mitotic spindle formation which arrest the cell cycle at metaphase, inducing apoptosis. It has similar indications and adverse effects as vincristine, discussed in the previous case. However, vinblastine has been shown to be significantly more effective at inhibiting microtubule polymerization in vitro and is associated with worse neurologic side effects.
- **Dacarbazine**: The exact MOA of dacarbazine is unclear. However, dacarbazine may act as a purine analogue and antimetabolite. In addition, it is extensively metabolized in the liver and produces intermediates some of which have alkylating activity, causing methylation, modification and cross linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Current indications include Hodgkin lymphoma and metastatic malignant melanoma usually in combination with other antineoplastic agents.
    - Dacarbazine is associated with a severe and distinctive liver injury which typically arises during the second or third cycle of therapy and most likely represents severe acute sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Patients typically develop the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability and rapidly rising levels of serum aminotransferase levels and prothrombin time, with death within 1 to 10 days [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548913/)


## Salvage Regimen

### Accelerated fractionation involved field radiotherapy (IFRT)

Radiation therapy has moved towards irradiating as little unnecessary tissue as possible. Initial treatments via extended field RT or mantle radiation would treat a large area of the neck, chest, armpits, and mediastinum, which is the area of the chest between the lungs, to cover all areas with cancer involvement. It also treated nearby lymph nodes thought to be at risk of disease. **IFRT** (involved field radiotherapy) was introduced for early stage HL and only treats effected anatomical regions. **ISRT/INRT** (involved site/nodal RT) target even smaller regions, directing radiation at only the effeced nodes (INRT) or nodes and immediatley surrounding site (ISRT). All techniques have similar efficacy in achieving remission, but exposure of sensitive regions and resulting increases in secondary malignancy are reduced with smaller treatment zones.

It is now routine to utilize ABVD followed by consolidative RT in early-stage classical HL in adolescent, adolescent and young adult, and adult patients. ABVD has supplanted the need for extended radiotherapy fields but has not yet eliminated the involved field RT (IFRT) consolidation. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4708267/)

A fraction is given each day and repeated over many days to add up to the total dose of radiation. Accelerated fractionation involves decreasing the interval between fractions, irradiating the target several times per day and on weekends.

### ICE Preconditioning
- **Ifosfamide**: ifosfamide is an alkylating agent which covalently crosslinks DNA at guanine N7 position
between strands and within strands. It requires bioactivation by liver. Ifosfamide is commonly used as part of a chemotherepeutic regimen in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.
    - Adverse effects include hemorrhagic cystitis which can be prevented with mesna or N-acetylcysteine whose thiol group binds acrolein, a toxic metabolite. Myelosuppression and potentially deadly hepatic veno-occlusion may occur.
- **Carboplatin**: The mechanism of action of carboplatin has been associated with ability to crosslink with the urine bases on the DNA to form DNA adducts, preventing repair of the DNA leading to DNA damage and subsequently induces apoptosis within cancer cells. However, the drug exhibits certain level of resistance including increased repair of the damaged DNA, reduction in the accumulation of the drug intracellular and cytosolic inactivation of cisplatin. The drug is also characterized by various toxic side effects including nausea, nephrotoxicity, Cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. However, it is generally more well tolerated than cisplatin, from which it is derived, due to different pharmacodynamic properties. [[ref]](https://biomedpharmajournal.org/vol12no1/review-on-pharmacology-of-cisplatin-clinical-use-toxicity-and-mechanism-of-resistance-of-cisplatin/)
- **Etoposide**: Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor. Its mechanism of action is primarily in the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.Topoisomerase II is cut both strands of the DNA helix simultaneously. It creates and reseals double-stranded DNA breaks during the replication process. Etoposide poisons the topoisomerase II cleavage complexes and inhibiting the second step of the reaction, DNA re-ligation. The etoposide-topoisomerase II complex triggers a mutagenic and cell death pathway, working best in tumor cells with higher levels of topoisomerase II enzymes. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557864/)
    - Etoposide is relativley well tolerated compared to other chemo agents. Common adverse effects include alopecia and gastrointestinal toxicity. GI toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis. The dose limiting side effect is myelosuppression.
    - Etoposide has been linked to t-AML, with particularly high rates of translocation on chromosome 11q23 in associated cases.

### Chemo (CBV)
- **Cyclophasphamide**: a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent mainly indicated for use in the treatment of malignant lymphomas stages III and IV, as designated by the Ann Arbor staging system. These may include Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphocytic lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The drug is not cell-cycle phase-specific and metabolizes to an active form capable of inhibiting protein synthesis through DNA and RNA crosslinking. Aldophosphamide is cleaved to the active alkylating agent phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. The phosphoramide metabolite forms cross-linkages within and between adjacent DNA strands at the guanine N-7 position. These modifications are permanent and eventually lead to programmed cell death. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553087/)
    - Acrolein has no antitumor activity but is the principal-agent responsible for the manifestation of hemorrhagic cystitis. IV saline and **Mesna** (a sulfhydryl compound that reacts with acrolein) can reduce or eliminate the cystitis.
    - It is often included in standard treatment regimens for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a component of CHOP along with hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone. If the malignancy has B-cell involvement, rituximab, and an anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibody, it is added to the CHOP regimen (called R-CHOP)
- **Carmustine**: also known as BCNN. A nitrosurea alkylating/crosslinking agent activated in the liver often used for glial tumors. Also used in the treatment of lymphomas, leukemia, malignant melanoma, and other neoplasms. Extremely high doses are associated with encephalopathy and seizure.
- **Etoposide**: see above

## Autologous Stem Cell Transplant [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554010/)

1. **Stem Cell Stimulation**
   - The use of chemotherapy in combination with G-CSF is the preferred way of mobilization for all patients who will need further decrease of tumor burden and/or who have to collect a high number of HSC.
        - The major advantages of steady-state mobilization (no chemo) are the relatively low toxicity, the predictable time of leukapheresis, the outpatient administration, and the reduced costs compared to chemo-mobilization. The major disadvantages are variable mobilization failure rates and the lower CD34+ cell yields compared to chemo-mobilization. 
        - CY in a dose of 2–4 g/m2 is widely used for HSC mobilization. It is also possible to mobilize HSC not by a separate chemotherapy but as part of the disease-specific chemotherapy, e.g., to mobilize HSC following salvage treatment with R-DHAP or R-ICE in lymphoma patients.
   - G-CSF promotes stem cell multiplication and migration from bone marrow to blood (mobilization).
        - CD34 is routinely used to identify and isolate human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for use clinically in bone marrow transplantation
        - Plerixafor in combination with G-CSF can increase yields.
2. **Stem Cell Collection**
   - Stem cells are collected via apheresis (leukapheresis)
        - Apheresis uses a centrifuge that separates blood into its components by density.
        - The target quantity of HSC to be collected is dependent on the underlying disease. Most patients with NHL or HL (expect for rare case of patients with HL who require double auto-HSCT) will need one autograft. The generally accepted minimum CD34+ cell yield to proceed to transplantation is 2 × 106 cells/kg; however, higher yields of 4–5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg are aimed for at many centers since they have been associated with faster neutrophil and platelet recovery, reduced hospitalization, blood transfusions, and antibiotic therapy.
   - A cannula or central line is used for blood withdrawal and separation of stem cells.
   - The duration of one leukapheresis session should not exceed 5 h, and the total number of leukapheresis session should not exceed four procedures
3. **Stem Cell Preservation**
   - Stem cells undergo cryopreservation using liquid nitrogen.
   - Rest period at home for about a month follows.
4. **High-Dose Chemotherapy**
   - Hospitalization for a week before transplant.
   - Intensive chemotherapy to eliminate lymphoma cells and clear space in bone marrow.
   - Side effects include intense nausea, diarrhea, mouth sores, flu-like symptoms, and infection risk.
5. **Stem Cell Transplantation**
   - Thawed stem cells are reinfused intravenously post-chemotherapy.
   - Similar to a blood transfusion, takes about an hour.
   - Possible side effects include stomach cramps and nausea.
6. **Engraftment**
   - New stem cells develop into blood cells over a few weeks (engraftment).
   - Hospital stay for 1–3 weeks, with infection risk.
   - Regular check-ups post-discharge, decreasing in frequency over time.
