## Diagnosis

### Differential [[ref]](https://www.visualdx.com/visualdx/differential/dyspnea/chest-pain+postpartum-state?moduleId=100&age=5&sex=F&findingId=20056,20009,26994&reqFId=20056&sort=W#view=default&tab=common)
- PE: blood clot in pulmonary vessels typically originating from DVT
- Tension pneumothorax: air accumulation between visceral and parietal pleura with mediastinal shift which compromises cardiac function
- Aortic dissection: intramural tear of aorta, often in intimal layer.
- Pericardial effusion: Accumulation of fluid in pericardial cavity
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Generalized anxiety 
- Dilated cardiomyopathy: RL ventricular dilation and reduced contractility.
- DIC: generalized coagulation activation leading to thrombosis and consumption of cogulation factors leading to simultaneous hemorrhage. 


### Testing
- EKG [[ref]](https://www.cardiacdirect.com/how-to-read-an-ekg-strip-in-5-steps/)
   - ID p-wave: PR interval goes from start of P to beginning of QRS
      - p-wave should be present and upright, no longer or taller than one large box
      - PR interval should be between 0.12 and 0.2 seconds (each small box is 0.04 seconds)
   - ID QRS complex: corresponds to ventricular depolarization
      - normal length is between 0.06 and 0.12 seconds
   - ID rhythm
      - Regular: constant R-R interval
      - Regularly irregular: variable R-R interval with pattern
      - Irregularly irregular: unpredictable R-R interval 
- Blood tests (Troponins, D-dimer) [[ref]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22770-troponin-test)
   - Normal troponins: 0-0.04 ng/mL for Troponin I, 0-0.01 ng/mL for Troponin T
   - Normal D-dimer: < 0.50 g/L
- CXR [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9936914/)
   - Can see tapering of pulmonary artery on CXR
![PE on CXR with Fleischner, Westmark, knuckles signs](/img/PE_cxr.jpg)
   - Fleischer sign: prominent central pulmonary artery associated with acute PE which leads to increased proximal vessel pressure and dilation
   - Westermark sign: regional area of decreased lung parenchymal markings with sharp cutoff, likely due to oligemia resulting from PE
   - Knuckle sign: abrupt tapering or cutoff of pulmonary artery secondary to PE
- CT scan 
   - Can confirm PE, right heart failure, increased R/L ventricular ratio

### Contrast Agents [[ref]](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/safety-contrast)
- Iodine based: typically given IV or IA for imaging of internal organs and angiograms. Increase absorption of X-ray. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770975)
   - Can cause allergic reaction and nephrotoxicity. Ensure proper hydration, especially in pt. with pre-existing kidney disease.
   - Mild reaction presents as headache, nausea, vomiting and arm pain. Intermediate and severe reations include hypotension, bronchospasm, respiratory arrest, angioedema, and seizure (< 0.2% have severe rxn)
- Barium-sulfate compounds: most common oral contrast medium for GI tract x-ray and CT. Block x-rays, providing clear outline of GI organs.
   - Can cause constipation, but generally safe as not absorbed by body. Contraindicated with suspected GI perforation
- Gadolinium: most often used in MRI to enhance blood vessel visibility
   - Some concerns about nephrotoxicity in patients with severe kidney disease but otherwise considered safe.

### Tests

#### Duplex ultrasound
Involves using high frequency sound waves to look at the speed of blood flow, and structure of the leg veins. The term "duplex" refers to the fact that two modes of ultrasound are used, Doppler and B-mode. The B-mode transducer (like a microphone) obtains an image of the vessel being studied.

_Pressure ultrasound indicating popliteal vein occlusion_
   * CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA): introduced in the 1990s as an alternative to ventilation/perfusion scanning (V/Q scan). Iodine contrast is rapidly infused prior to CT scan

### Normal Ventilation and Perfusion

Ideally, we would want V/Q = 1 for optimal oxygenation

#### V/Q Scan [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK564428/)
An aerosol and injectable radioactive tracer are used to assess lung ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) to identify V/Q mismatch areas. The most common clinical indication for a V/Q lung scan is to assess the likelihood of pulmonary embolism (PE) when contrast or radiation exposure is contraindicated (pregnancy, renal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or more, or severe contrast allergy).
   - Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) obtains the image through multidetector gamma-cameras to generate three-dimensional images
   - Planar imaging acquisition is a two-dimensional technique obtained through a dual-head gamma camera for ventilation and perfusion scans, respectively. Limited patient movement between the two scans is crucial.This technique is used with at least four views when the V/Q SPECT is not feasible.

#### VQ Interpretation
* Matched- ventilation and perfusion defects are concordant with each other. This occurs when the perfusion defect is in correspondence with the ventilatory abnormality. 
* Mismatched- defect in perfusion with either normal or near-normal ventilation. Mismatched defects can be seen in pulmonary embolism, veno-occlusive disease, tumor obstructing an artery, or radiation therapy.
* Reverse mismatched- defect in ventilation with either normal or less severe corresponding perfusion defect.

Defect size can be calculated as:
1. Large more than 75% of the segment 
2. Moderate 25 to 75% of the segment
3. Small less than 25% of the segment

PE is indicated by presence of **one or more wedge-shaped perfusion defects**

## Pathophysiology

### DVT

DVT occurs when a blood clot occurs in the "deep veins" (popliteal, femoral, or iliac) of the legs, thighs, or pelvis - proximal DVT. If part or all of the thrombus breaks off, it can cause pulmonary embolism (PE). Can also occur in peroneal, posterior, anterior tibial, and muscular veins of calf (distal DVT) with lower risk of PE. DVT in left femoral vein is known as an illiofemoral DVT which is associated with higher PE risk and higher reoccurrence.

DVT are more common after inactivity or immobilization. Cancer, old age, previous DVT/PE, obesity, pregnancy, smoking, heart failure, kidney issues, some medications, and recent surgery all increase DVT risk. People with inherited or acquired thrombophilia are also at higher risk.

Generally look for increased clotting risk: Virchow's triad for clot risk includes intravascular vessel wall damage, stasis of flow, and the presence of a hypercoagulable state.

#### Postpartum Hypercoaguability [[ref]](https://ashpublications.org/hematology/article/2009/1/277/19806/Pregnancy-associated-thrombosis)

Normal pregnancy is accompanied by increased concentrations of **factors VII, VIII, X and von Willebrand factor** and by pronounced increases in **fibrinogen**. Factors II, V and IX are relatively unchanged. Free protein S, the active, unbound form, is decreased during pregnancy. _Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels are increased fivefold_. Levels of PAI-2, produced by the placenta, increase dramatically during the third trimester. Markers of thrombin generation such as prothrombin F1 + 2 and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes are also increased. These changes, which may not completely return to baseline until more than 8 weeks postpartum, begin with conception and result in the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy.

During the first 6 weeks postpartum, the risk of venous thromboembolism is 20- to 80-fold higher, and in the first week, the risk is 100-fold higher.

#### Other risk factors

1. **Smoking**:
   - **Endothelial Dysfunction**: Smoking damages the endothelium, making them more prone to thrombosis.
   - **Increased platelet Aggregation**
   - **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine causes vasoconstriction
2. **Birth Control (Hormonal Contraceptives)**:
   - **Estrogen Effect**: Many birth control methods, especially combined oral contraceptives, contain estrogen, which can increase the production of clotting factors and make the blood more prone to clotting.
   - **Reduced Blood Flow**
3. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)**:
   - **Hypoxia**: OSA is characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, leading to periods of low oxygen (hypoxia). Hypoxia can induce a hypercoagulable state.
   - **Inflammation**: OSA can also increase systemic inflammation, which is a known risk factor for thrombosis.
   - **Endothelial Dysfunction**: Chronic intermittent hypoxia and inflammation associated with OSA can lead to endothelial dysfunction, further predisposing to DVT.
4. **COVID-19**:
   - **Systemic Inflammation**: COVID-19 can lead to a pronounced inflammatory response, known as a "cytokine storm," which can promote clot formation.
   - **Endothelial Injury**: The virus can directly infect and damage the endothelial cells of blood vessels, making them more thrombogenic.
   - **Hypercoagulability**: Many patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit laboratory markers of a hypercoagulable state.
   - **Immobilization**: Hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19 might be immobilized for extended periods, which can reduce blood flow and increase DVT risk.

#### Symptoms and testing

Swelling, warmth, pain, and tenderness to the touch in the affected leg. Weekly compression ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice, but d-dimer (>500 ng/mL) or MRI/CT may also be used. In positive DVT, vein will not compress with pressure under ultrasound.

#### Treatment

- Anticoagulants: LMW Heparin, unfractionated heparin (in dialysis patients), or fondaparinux are first line treatments used for 5-10d. 
   - This is usually followed by long term antigoagulation for 3-12mo via warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs i.e. factor Xa inhibitors Eliquis, Xarelto) help prevent new clots. People with unknown cause or multiple episodes may continue anticoagulation indefinitely.
- Walking helps patient feel better faster after symptoms under control with anticoagulation.
- In life-threatening cases, "clot-busting" thyrombolytic drugs are used to dissolve the blood clots, ideally immediately after diagnosis. 
- Inferior vena cava filter can be used in high bleed risk patients to prevent PE, but can increase long term risk.

Patients with >13% risk of bleed should not be anticoagulated.

### Pulmonary Embolism [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665123/)

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death after myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Occurs after DVT detach and embolise occluding pulmonary circulation. Larger emboli wedge in main artery while peripheral PE can lead to pulmonary infarct and hemorrhage.

Humoral release at infarct site can cause widespread pulmonary vasoconstriction and RV failure. Can result in MI if heart failure progresses to LV.

#### Risk factors
- Genetic:
   - Antithrombin, protein C and protein S deficiencies
   - Elevated factor VIII
   - Thrombomodulin insufficiency
- Acquired:
   - Low: Extended immobility, obesity, current pregnancy
   - Moderate: Chemo, congestive heart or respiratory failure, hormone replacement/contraception, malignancy, or postpartum status
   - High: Hip/knee fracture or replacement. Major surgery, trauma, or spinal injury

#### Diagnosis

Characteristic signs and symptoms such as tachycardia, dyspnea, chest pain, hypoxemia, and shock are non-specific and are present in many other conditions, such as acute MI, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia. Chest pain usually results from infarct and subsequent irratation of pleura. Several scoring criteria exist, such as the Modified Wells Criteria below:

![Wells Modified](/img/wells_criteria.jpg)

D-dimer is indicated in low-suspicion cases with no other reasons for elevation (i.e. trauma, recent operation). Ultrasound to detect DVT and CT or V/Q scan are always indicated in case of suspected PE. Echo is often non-specific but McConnell's sign (RV dilation with free wall akinesis) is highly suggestive of PE.

The right sided ventricular failure (dilation or hypertrophy) due to primary disorder of respiratory system (i.e. PE) is known as _cor pulmonale_ and is often accompanied by mild pulmonary hypertension. 

Look for `S1Q3T3` on EKG (large S in L1, large Q and inverted T in L3)

![PE EKG](/img/PE_EKG.jpg)
_Note large S wave in L1 (big valleys) and inverted T in L3_

- Saddle PE: straddle main pulmonary artery bifurcation and can significantly impede blood flow. Often causes serious acute symptoms and is emergent
- Segmental/Subsegmental PE: Emboli in the smaller peripheral arteries. Less immediatley dangerous but can still cause issues and usually require anticoagulation unless there is low risk of VTE and no DVT on ultrasound.

### Hypoxia and Hypercoagulation

PE leads to impaired gas exchange due to obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed leading to a mismatch in the ventilation to perfusion ratio because alveolar ventilation remains the same, but pulmonary capillary blood flow decreases, effectively leading to dead space ventilation and hypoxemia.

Hypoxemia in the deep veins stasis also can lead to initiation of thrombus formation. Hypoxia induced endothelial activation and inflammation lead to hyper coagulation through upregulation of tissue factor. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7287429)

## Treatment

### Unfractionated Heparin 
Unfractionated heparin is an anticoagulant indicated for both the prevention and treatment of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as atrial fibrillation. 

#### MOA
Binding to antithrombin blocks several different factors of the clotting cascade, but two are predominant: thrombin (Factor IIa) and Factor Xa. By inactivating thrombin, it blocks the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin; this prevents the formation of clots and prolongs the clotting time of blood. Heparin does not affect bleeding time, but it does prolong the time that blood takes to clot.

#### Adverse effects
Thrombocytopenia typically occurs in up to 30% of patients who receive heparin. Most often, this is not significant; however, there is a form of thrombocytopenia that is more serious, known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Heparin should not be given if platelets are < 100,000/mm or cannot have routine monitoring. Also contraindicated in active hemorrhage. Toxicity of unfractionated heparin can be reversed via IV protamine. However, LMW heparin is only partially neutralized. 

### LMW Heparin
Used in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) on acute or elective admission to the hospital, and they are used in the treatment of deep vein thromboses (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Administered SC. Has slower onset than Heparin as it only inhibits Xa (not IIa). 

Like unfractionated Heparin, LMW heparin is contraindicated with recent trauma, epidural half-life, hemorrhagic disorders, peptic ulcer disease, recent cerebral hemorrhage, severe hypertension, and recent surgery to the eye or nervous system. 

## Non-Clinical Factors

### Four Pillars of Medical Ethics [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2540719/)
1. Beneficence (doing good)
2. Non-maleficence (to do no harm)
3. Autonomy (giving the patient the freedom to choose freely, where they are able)
4. Justice (ensuring fairness)

The pillars provide physicians with an unbiased and culturally neutral way to evaluate the ethical considerations and ramifications of a case. In this particular instance, the patient's autonomy was infringed by lack of communication and justice was not upheld, as she was not treated fairly due to her sex.

### Communication [[ref]](https://www.hipaajournal.com/effects-of-poor-communication-in-healthcare/)

Communication failures most commonly occur during shift changes, when care of a patient is handed over to a different caregiver. When incomplete, inaccurate, or ambiguous information is provided at the changeover it increases the probability of medical mistakes occurring. Poor communication could lead to patients receiving the wrong treatment or procedure, being given incorrect medication, or could result in delays to essential tests and treatments – all of which may negatively affect patient outcomes.

The most common communication failures between clinicians involve the miscommunication of important information about a patient’s symptoms or condition and poor documentation of patient information.

### Metacognition [[ref]](https://acpinternist.org/archives/2020/02/bias-metacognition-and-their-roles-in-our-critical-thinking.htm)

When relying on heuristics, our thinking is limited due to the effect of our own inherent cognitive biases. I am demonstrating an anchoring bias if the situation makes me unduly persuaded by features encountered early in the case, thereby committing to a premature diagnosis. I hear hoofbeats and so I am thinking horses from the start. I might also exhibit recall bias because the last hundred times I heard hoofbeats, they were horses. Yet if in a given case I end up with a zebra and not a horse, my heuristic steered me wrong. I was “biased” into thinking erroneously.
