## Dopamine

### Dopaminergic Pathways
- **Mesolimbic**: transmits dopamine from VTA to ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). Reward-related cognition (such as incentive salience, pleasure, postitive reinforcement)
- **Mesocortical**: executive function, transmits dopamine from VTA to prefrontal cortex
- **Nigrostriatal**: transmits dopamine from substantia nigra in midbrain to caudate nucleus and putamen. Motor function and reward-related cognition
- **Tuberoinfundibular**: transmits dopamine from hypothalamus to pituitary gland controlling prolactin secretion

### Dopamine Metabolism

Majority catecholamine in brain synthesized from L-DOPA (which is in turn synthesized indirectly from phenylalanine or directly from tyrosine). Incapable of crossing the BBB. Precursor in the synthesis of norepinephrine and epinepherine.

![Dop Met](/img/dopamine_metabolism.jpg)

Homovanillic acid is the primary breakdown product of dopamine metabolism (via COMT and MAO in _either order_) and can be measured in plasma to estimate dopamine activity in the brain. Epinephrine and noreprine are similarly broken down by COMT and MOA and result in the formation of vanillylmandelic acid. If they are broken down by COMT first, metanephrines are formed (these are measured for diagnosis of phenochromocytoma).

Dopamine is moved from cytosol into storage in synaptic vesicles by VMAT2 (a vesicular monoamine transporter) until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis triggered by AP mediated calcium influx or TAAR1 receptor activation. It is released phasically by the mechanisms stated above and tonically (low level constant release).

### Dopamine Receptors

### High-level Dopamine Action

Dopamine contributes to the action selection process in at least two important ways. First, it sets the "threshold" for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement—however, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including, at the extreme, psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements.

Cocaine, substituted amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), and other psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine levels in the brain by a variety of mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.

## Parkinson's Disease [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201713)

Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3% of the population ≥65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of α-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. 

### Epidemiology and Risk
It is very rare prior to 50 y.o. with incidence increase 5-10 fold from 60-90 y.o. It is also about twice as common in men than in women in most populations. 

There is not a clear association with race, though certain genes (detailed below) are more prevalent in populations including Ashkenazi Jews, Inuits, and Native American populations. 

#### Genetics

About 10% of patients with PD report positive family history, and even less have a confirmed genetic etiology. Out of the six genes unequivocally linked to heritable, monogenic PD, mutations in SNCA (PARK1-4), and LRRK2 (PARK8) are responsible for autosomal-dominant PD forms, and mutations in Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ-1 (PARK7), and ATP13A2 (PARK9) are accountable for PD that displays an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253033/).

- **SNCA**: Missense cause classic phenotpe. Duplication causes early-onset Oarkinson with prominent dementia
- **LRRK2**: Increased risk and can be direct single cause of Parkinson
- **Parkin**: Lower limb dystonia
- **PINK1**: Psychiatric issues prominent
- **DJ-1**: Early-onset
- **ATP13A2**: Juvenile-onset with complex phenotype (e.g. dystonia, supranuclear gaze palsy, pyramidal signs, and cognitive dysfunction). The collection of symptoms is known as Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. Extremely rare. [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C1847640/)

Mortality is increased 10y.o. after disease onset.

### Histology

![Parkinson_histo](/img/parkinson_histo.png)
    _α-synuclein Lewy pathologies are most prominent in the medial temporal lobe region (a), but over time there is an increase in neocortical and subcortical pathology (b,c). About 50% of patients also have tau and/or β-amyloid plaques_

### Pathology

Loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and deposition of α-synuclein in neurons together are specific for idiopathic Parkinson disease.

![Pathology](/img/parkinson_patho.webp)
    _(a) Substantia nigra depigmentation, (b-d) normal, moderate, and severe pigmented cell loss, (e-g) α-synuclein deposition, (h) progression of α-synuclein aggregation in PD without Alzheimer pathology._

Classic PD progression is classified by Braak stages I-VI. α-synuclein inclusions begin in cholenergic and monoaminergic lower brainstem nerons in asymptomatic patients (I-II) and infiltrate similar neurons in the midbrain and basal forebrain in patients with motor PD symptoms (III-IV). Progression to the limbic and neocortical regions cause behavioral and cognitive symptoms (V, VI).

#### α-Synuclein
Intraneuronal protein aggregates that are largely made up of α-synuclein are found in all patients with Parkinson disease. The existence of point mutations and multiplications of SNCA, the gene encoding α-synuclein, that cause heritable forms of Parkinson disease strongly support the notion that α-synuclein is a key player in Parkinson disease. The normal neuronal function of the 140 amino acid α-synuclein protein is not fully understood, but it occurs in the cytosol, possibly also in mitochondria and the nucleus, and probably has a role in synaptic vesicle dynamics, mitochondrial function, intracellular trafficking and might be a potential chaperone

α-Synuclein acquires neurotoxic properties during a pathogenetic process in which soluble α-synuclein monomers initially form oligomers, then progressively combine to form small protofibrils and eventually large, insoluble α-synuclein fibrils (that is, the aggregates that make up Lewy pathology) Degredation is maintained by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and lysosomal autophagy system. 

Recent papers have propsed a prion-like mechanism for propogation of α-synuclein, and helps explain the prodromal anosmia and constipation which occasionally occur as a stage of disease prior to prion migration from the olfactory bulb and enteric nervous system prior to motor symptoms.

#### Mitochondria
Activity of mitochondrial complex I, a compound of the electron transport chain, is reduced in several tissues isolated from patients with Parkinson disease. This may be exasperated by α-synuclein aggregation inside the mitochondria. This causes impariment of calcium homeostasis and increase in reactive oxygen species which can cause enhanced protein misfolding and cell death which in turn can cause microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.

### Motor Effects

![Park_motor](/img/parkinson_motor.webp)
    _Direct pathway expresses D1 receptors while the indirect expresses D2 receptors. The pathways regulate GABAergic output of the basal ganglia. Parkinsonism is associated with strong increase in GABAergic activity in the basal ganglia which over-inhibit downstream thalamocortical and brainstem areas_

### Cognitive Effects [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-021-00280-3)

![Cog Park](/img/Parkinson_cog_impaired.png)

### Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and either rigidity or rest tremor. One must exlude atypical parkinsonism, drug0induced parkinsonism, and essential tremor.

The clinical diagnosis must be supported either by L-DOPA responsiveness, presence of classic rest remor, presence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, the presence of either olfactory loss or cardiac sympathetic denervation on metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.

Red flags such as rapid gait impairment or autonomic failure require futher investigation but are not absolute exlusion criteria.

Imaging includes F-DOPA-PET which displays asymmetric and reduced uptake in the putamen. MRI can show lac of intensity in the substantia nigra. 

### Treatment

![BNB Drugs](/img/parkinson_drugs.png)

![BNB MOA](/img/dopa_targets.webp)

Chronic use of L-DOPA can cause serious complications. Over 30% of patients will experience these after 2-3 years and over 50% will after 5 years. Risk is reduced by using lowest possible dose. Notably, symptoms are often "on and off". Dyskinesias associated with the on state are most often choreic in nature and affect the limb, trunk, face and neck, whereas movements associated with the off state are dystonic with painful cramps that chiefly affect the foot and lower limb.

Amantadine is often used to reduce L-DOPA side effects. It works as an NMDA antagonist. Effective life style management includes aerobic exercise, dual task training, and care management by qualified nursing personel. Therapy exploits compensantory pathways that bypass defective basal ganglia circuits. For example, patients with freezing gait may still be able to walk via pretending to ride a bike and adapting the pedaling motion to walking.

#### Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)

High frequency electrical stimulation of certain areas of the subthalamic nucleus can reduce motor symptoms. Other targeted areas include the globus pallidus internus and the thalamus itself. However, patients with motor symptoms unresponsive to L-DOPA are unlikley to respond to DBS (with an exception for drug-resistant tremor in patients otherwise well responsive). Patients with early-onset Parkinson's are most likley to fit inclusion criteria. 

#### Intestinal Pump Therapy

Levodopa–carbidopa intestinal gel pump therapy aims to reach stable plasma levodopa concentrations by ascertaining a continuous levodopa delivery via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy. A recent RCT demonstrated less off time and more on time than those taking oral medication. The main adverse effects were related to the pump therapy (tube replacements). Some people with Parkinson's disease developed severe polyneuropathies due to vitamin B12 deficiency, an issue which will require continuous monitoring.

### Progression

![Park_progress](/img/Progression.webp)

### Other disorders of Basal Ganglia

![BGDs](/img/basal_ganglia_disorders.png)

Wilson's Disease is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene located on chromosome 13q. Brain or neurological symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and auditory or visual hallucinations.

Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by involuntary choreatic movements with cognitive and behavioral disturbances. It occurs as a result of cytosine, adenine, and guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeats on the short arm of chromosome 4p16.3 in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. This mutation leads to an abnormally long expansion of the polyglutamine in the HTT protein, which leads to neurodegeneration. Behavioral/psychiatric  and cognitive symptoms often occur prior to motor dysfunction (which begins as hyperkinetic movement and progresses to hypokinisease with bradykinesia and dystonia).

## Gait abnormalities and other Synucleinopathies

### Non-Parkinson's Synucleinopathy

![Other Syno](/img/synucleinopathies.jpg)
    _Other examples of synucleinopathy include Demential with Lewey Bodies ()(DLB) multiple systems atrophy (MSA),pure autonomic failure (PAF) and isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD)_ 

Gait issues can be classified by clinical phenomenology. Predominant phenomes include motor dysfunction, imblanance/unsteadyness, and functional disorders.

### Case Medications

* **Carbidopa**:
  - Peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
  - Carbidopa prevents the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain and convert into dopamine.
* **Levodopa**:
  - Dopamine precursor and can cross the blood-brain barrier.
  - Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the brain, replenishing the depleted dopamine levels in Parkinson's disease.
  - Levodopa is usually combined with carbidopa (as Carbidopa/Levodopa) to enhance its bioavailability and reduce side effects.
* **Ropinirole**:
  - Non-ergot dopamine agonist that directly stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain.
  - Ropinirole helps to mimic the effects of dopamine and improve motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
  - Adverse effects:
    - Impulse control disorder (such as compulsive purchasing) is a potential side effect of dopamine agonists like ropinirole.
* **Entacapone**:
  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor.
  - Entacapone prolongs the therapeutic effect of levodopa by preventing its breakdown.
  - It is often used in combination with levodopa when the effect of levodopa starts wearing off before the next dose (known as the "wearing-off" phenomenon).
* **Quetiapine**:
  - Atypical antipsychotic medication.
  - In Parkinson's disease, quetiapine is used to treat psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations and delusions) that can occur as a side effect of dopaminergic therapy or as a result of the disease itself.
