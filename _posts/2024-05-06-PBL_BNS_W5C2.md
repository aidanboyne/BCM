## Dopamine

### Dopaminergic Pathways
- **Mesolimbic**: transmits dopamine from VTA to ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). Reward-related cognition (such as incentive salience, pleasure, postitive reinforcement)
- **Mesocortical**: executive function, transmits dopamine from VTA to prefrontal cortex
- **Nigrostriatal**: transmits dopamine from substantia nigra in midbrain to caudate nucleus and putamen. Motor function and reward-related cognition
- **Tuberoinfundibular**: transmits dopamine from hypothalamus to pituitary gland controlling prolactin secretion

### Dopamine Metabolism

Majority catecholamine in brain synthesized from L-DOPA (which is in turn synthesized indirectly from phenylalanine or directly from tyrosine). Incapable of crossing the BBB. Precursor in the synthesis of norepinephrine and epinepherine.

![Dop Met](/img/dopamine_metabolism.jpg)

Homovanillic acid is the primary breakdown product of dopamine metabolism (via a oxidoreductase enzyme) and can be measured in plasma to estimate dopamine activity in the brain. 

Dopamine is moved from cytosol into storage in synaptic vesicles by VMAT2 (a vesicular monoamine transporter) until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis triggered by AP mediated calcium influx or TAAR1 receptor activation. It is released phasically by the mechanisms stated above and tonically (low level constant release).

### High-level Dopamine Action

Dopamine contributes to the action selection process in at least two important ways. First, it sets the "threshold" for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement—however, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including, at the extreme, psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements.

Cocaine, substituted amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), and other psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine levels in the brain by a variety of mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.

## Parkinson's Disease [[ref]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201713)

Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3% of the population ≥65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of α-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. 

### Epidemiology and Risk
It is very rare prior to 50 y.o. with incidence increase 5-10 fold from 60-90 y.o. It is also about twice as common in men than in women in most populations. 

There is not a clear association with race, though certain genes (detailed below) are more prevalent in populations including Ashkenazi Jews, Inuits, and Native American populations. 

#### Genetics

About 10% of patients with PD report positive family history, and even less have a confirmed genetic etiology. Out of the six genes unequivocally linked to heritable, monogenic PD, mutations in SNCA (PARK1-4), and LRRK2 (PARK8) are responsible for autosomal-dominant PD forms, and mutations in Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ-1 (PARK7), and ATP13A2 (PARK9) are accountable for PD that displays an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance [[ref]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253033/).

- **SNCA**: Missense cause classic phenotpe. Duplication causes early-onset Oarkinson with prominent dementia
- **LRRK2**: Increased risk and can be direct single cause of Parkinson
- **Parkin**: Lower limb dystonia
- **PINK1**: Psychiatric issues prominent
- **DJ-1**: Early-onset
- **ATP13A2**: Juvenile-onset with complex phenotype (e.g. dystonia, supranuclear gaze palsy, pyramidal signs, and cognitive dysfunction). The collection of symptoms is known as Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. Extremely rare.

Mortality is increased 10y.o. after disease onset.

### Histology

![Parkinson_histo](/img/parkinson_histo.png)
    _α-synuclein Lewy pathologies are most prominent in the medial temporal lobe region (a), but over time there is an increase in neocortical and subcortical pathology (b,c). About 50% of patients also have tau and/or β-amyloid plaques_
